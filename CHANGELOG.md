# PACT — Changelog

> One line per change, **newest first**. `DATA.version` is noted only when it changed.
> This is the scannable, going-forward log; the full pre-GitHub history is in
> `docs/history/CHANGELOG-full.md`. *Why* lives in `DECISIONS.md`; the messy middle in `docs/sessions/`.

- **2026-07-21 · docs(sessions): corrected the 2026-07-20/2026-07-21 date-labeling mistake** — fixed
  everywhere across `family-hub`, `wildlife-explorer`, and PACT's own two session notes about them:
  decision IDs, `CHANGELOG.md` entry dates, and session-note filenames. Left every reference to the
  *other*, genuinely-pre-existing `2026-07-20` dates untouched in both target repos (family-hub's
  original Copilot planning session, wildlife-explorer's Milestone-5 planning log) — those are real,
  not mislabeled. Also left the two decision IDs a separate, concurrent status-review session added to
  wildlife-explorer (`D-2026-07-20-web-session-branch-override`, `D-2026-07-20-branch-model-confirmed`)
  untouched — no basis to assume those are wrong too. Done as new commits in each repo, not history
  rewrites, since `family-hub`'s and `wildlife-explorer`'s originals were already pushed.

- **2026-07-21 · docs(sessions): light-ported the memory-layer scaffold to a fifth repo,
  PACT_Players**: a Quartz-based campaign-content site, not a software project — full scaffold skipped
  (no `AGENTS.md`, no Effort/Risk task board), only `CHANGELOG.md`/`DECISIONS.md`/`sessions/` (repo-root,
  not `docs/sessions/` — that's Quartz's own vendored docs) plus 4 of 8 skills. Mid-port, discovered a
  concurrent session had already authored a real `TASKS.md`; adopted it rather than overwriting with a
  placeholder. Also caught (not yet fully corrected) a session-wide date-labeling mistake — this and the
  prior two ports were mislabeled `2026-07-20` when the actual date was `2026-07-21`. See
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-21-port-agents-scaffold-to-pact-players.md`.

- **2026-07-21 · docs(sessions): ported the AGENTS.md/skills scaffold to a fourth repo,
  wildlife-explorer**: additive, not build-fresh — unlike family-hub (ported moments earlier the same
  session), this repo already had a real governance file (`AI.md`) and a genuinely working
  `npm run check` test/build/encoding-audit gate, so `AGENTS.md` was scoped as a thin process-layer
  supplement rather than a competing entry point; `AI.md` was left completely untouched. Confirms a
  "three independent axes" shape space (governance layer / product docs / real verification gate, each
  present or absent independently) rather than a simple blank-vs-mature spectrum. Nothing in PACT itself
  changed beyond this session note; see
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-21-port-agents-scaffold-to-wildlife-explorer.md` for the full detail
  (target-repo decisions logged in wildlife-explorer's own `DECISIONS.md`).

- **2026-07-21 · docs(sessions): ported the AGENTS.md/skills scaffold to a third repo, family-hub**:
  same manual copy-and-adapt pattern as the `petdetective`/`homelife` ports, done directly against the
  local clone at `C:/Users/user/dev/family-hub`. A genuinely third target-repo shape — not blank-slate,
  not mature-with-conflicting-conventions, but rich product-planning docs with zero AI-workflow
  governance layer. Nothing in PACT itself changed beyond this session note; see
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-21-port-agents-scaffold-to-family-hub.md` for the full detail (target-repo
  decisions logged in family-hub's own `DECISIONS.md`, not duplicated here).

- **2026-07-20 · feat(tooling): close-code-session stages/commits/pushes once you approve the letter**:
  removed the `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` tool restriction at the user's explicit request — Part 3
  now surfaces "stage, commit, and push" as one of its lettered follow-ups and runs it once approved,
  instead of only ever printing the command for manual hand-off. The shared-checkout mitigation (never
  `git add -A`/`.`, always name exact files, re-check `git status` right before staging) is unchanged and
  still applies regardless of who runs the add. Merging, rebasing, resetting, and deleting are still always
  disallowed. See `D-GH-2026-07-20-close-code-session-run-commit`.

- **2026-07-20 · chore(repo): swept 126 stale remote branches + 6 local worktree remnants**: local
  cleanup removed 1 merged local branch/worktree (`feat/clone-char-standalone`, its lock stale — the
  claimed PID wasn't running) and 5 orphaned `.git/worktrees/` admin dirs left over from past
  `ExitWorktree` runs that never fully cleaned up (these were also the cause of the "Permission
  denied" noise on every `git fetch` this session and prior sessions — resolved). Remote cleanup
  classified all 129 `origin/*` branches against their PR history (`main`/`preview` never touched):
  114 merged via PR, 2 closed without merging, 2 with no PR but fully absorbed into `preview`, and 8
  with no PR and genuine unique commits — all verified superseded/already-shipped duplicates from
  concurrent sessions except one (`claude/remote-control-149hqs`, held back pending its stored-XSS
  fix); confirmed that fix already shipped via an identical parallel-session commit already on `main`
  (`8660d42`, same message/timestamp as the held branch's `b3f7df3`), then deleted it too. Full
  methodology and the Windows/Git-Bash CRLF pitfall hit along the way: see
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-20-remote-branch-worktree-cleanup.md`.

- **2026-07-20 · docs(tooling): close-code-session's session-note step writes without pausing**:
  Part 1 item 3 (`docs/sessions/<date>-<topic>.md`) now says explicitly that once the write
  criteria are evaluated, the file is written (or skipped) immediately in the same turn — no
  presenting the evaluation as a question and waiting for a reply first. Closes the gap flagged
  in the `TASK_BOARD.md` entry this graduates; the user had been missing session-note writes
  because a prior run paused for confirmation that the skill never actually required.

- **2026-07-19 · docs(terminology): replaced "roadmap" with "task board" everywhere it referred to
  `docs/TASK_BOARD.md`**: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`, and all 6
  `.claude/commands/*.md` skill files (9 files, ~38 occurrences) — including `/add-code-task`'s own
  future-commit template (`docs(roadmap): ...` → `docs(task-board): ...`), so new task-board-addition
  commits use the new scope going forward. `CHANGELOG.md`/`DECISIONS.md`/`docs/sessions/*.md` left
  untouched, same as the earlier `-code-` command rename — dated historical record, not rewritten.
  "Roadmap" was never a stale filename reference (the file has always been `docs/TASK_BOARD.md`), just
  informal vocabulary for the same thing; the two terms coexisting caused real confusion, so picked one.
  Docs/skill-file text only — no code or rules touched, parity unaffected (still 20/0).

- **2026-07-19 · chore(release): bump BUILD to v0.203**: mirrored across all three tools per
  `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` (CharGen's line-1 comment, `<title>`, header `.sub` label, and its
  JS-side title-template string; Live Sheet's line-1 comment; DM Console's `TOOL_VERSION`).
  Cosmetic build-number bump only — `DATA.version` unchanged, parity still 20/0. The earlier
  cloud-session restriction that blocked a plain `git tag`+`git push` and a `gh api .../releases`
  POST (see `docs/sessions/2026-07-19-github-release-tag-cloud-session-restriction.md`) was
  specific to that cloud-session proxy — a local session tagged `v0.203` and pushed it on
  2026-07-19 without issue, and GitHub auto-generated the matching Release from the tag push.
  Both now exist: https://github.com/Chompy78/PACT/releases/tag/v0.203.

- **2026-07-19 · fix(feedback) — fixed CSS specificity collision hiding the anon checkbox
  incorrectly**: `js/feedback.js`'s `.pact-fb-anon{display:flex}` rule had the same
  specificity/origin as the browser's built-in `[hidden]{display:none}` rule and won by source order,
  so `anonWrap.hidden = true` (the signed-out default) never actually hid the "submit anonymously"
  checkbox row. Scoped the selector to `.pact-fb-anon:not([hidden])` so the browser's own `[hidden]`
  rule applies again. Verified in a real browser (Playwright/Chromium, isolated harness with a stubbed
  Supabase client): signed-out now computes `display:none` (no checkbox/empty box); signed-in still
  computes `display:flex` with a working, checkable checkbox. Display-only, no `DATA.version`/engine
  impact; parity still 20/0.

- **2026-07-19 · fix(feedback) — inlined the "submit anonymously" checkbox with its contact note**:
  `js/feedback.js`'s checkbox (shown only to signed-in users) previously rendered as its own row below
  the "Optional — only if you'd like a reply..." note; both now share one flex row
  (`.pact-fb-note-row`), checkbox first. Verified in a real browser (Playwright/Chromium, isolated
  harness with a stubbed Supabase client) at both a normal width and the 420px mobile breakpoint, in
  both the signed-out (checkbox absent) and signed-in (checkbox inline) states. Display-only, no
  `DATA.version`/engine impact; parity still 20/0. While verifying, found a separate pre-existing bug
  (the signed-out checkbox isn't actually hidden due to a CSS specificity collision) — filed as its own
  roadmap task rather than folded into this fix, since it predates this change and isn't scoped to it.
- **2026-07-19 · chore(release) — graduated A6 (tag releases to build version)**: confirmed done —
  `v0.107` was tagged with a GitHub Release on 2026-07-17; no further action needed, so the task-board
  entry (which had flagged itself for human confirmation) is removed.

- **2026-07-19 · fix(pwa) — closed the last two PWA-completeness gaps: manifest + apple-touch-icon on
  every HTML entry point**: `login.html` and `docs/PACT-Players-Guide.html` gained `<link rel="manifest">`
  (previously only `index.html` and the three tools declared it); all five non-`index.html` entry points
  (`login.html`, the Player's Guide, and all three tools) gained `<link rel="apple-touch-icon"
  href="/PACT/icons/apple-touch-icon.png">`, matching the tag `index.html` got in the previous PWA fix —
  DM Console included, since the browser-tab-favicon exclusion it got in an earlier change was never
  reasoned to extend to the home-screen icon. Every new link uses the absolute `/PACT/...` path, matching
  `manifest.json`'s own convention (the existing tool favicon links use a relative path — a pre-existing
  inconsistency, left as-is). HTML well-formedness verified (all 5 files parse cleanly); no `js/engine.js`
  change, parity 20/0.

- **2026-07-19 · fix(pwa) — bumped service-worker cache + widened network-first coverage + wired the
  missing apple-touch-icon**: `CACHE_NAME` `pact-v6`→`pact-v7`, forcing already-installed/returning users
  to pick up `js/character-store.js` (cache-first; holds this session's Continue-feature `recordAutosave`,
  which was otherwise stuck stale for them indefinitely). Also widened `NETWORK_FIRST_RE` to cover
  `js/ui-helpers.js` (holds `esc()`, the shared XSS-escaping helper all three tools call), `js/ap-by-level.js`,
  and `js/advancement.js` — same "costs nothing, only speeds up fix propagation" reasoning as
  D-GH-2026-07-16-sw-network-first-security-modules, applied to three files that were added since and never
  covered; added all three to `PRE_CACHE` too, matching every other network-first file. Separately, added a
  `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` to `index.html` — the correctly-sized asset (`/icons/apple-touch-icon.png`)
  already existed and was in `manifest.json`, but no page actually referenced it via the explicit tag iOS
  Safari's "Add to Home Screen" relies on most reliably. Engine untouched, parity 20/0.

- **2026-07-19 · chore(commands) — renamed all 8 Claude Code custom commands to carry `-code-`**: `add-task`→
  `add-code-task`, `cleanup-branches`→`cleanup-code-branches`, `close-session`→`close-code-session`,
  `log-ai-lessons`→`log-code-lesson`, `pick-task`→`pick-code-task`, `plan-for-review`→
  `make-code-cold-plan-review`, `run-task`→`run-code-task`, `sweep-tasks`→`sweep-code-tasks` — distinguishes
  them at a glance from the author's separate `-chat-` Claude.ai Skills. Updated every cross-reference in
  `.claude/commands/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md` (which also gained an old→new mapping table),
  `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`, `docs/TASK_BOARD.md`, and `.gitignore`. `CHANGELOG.md`/`DECISIONS.md`/
  `docs/sessions/` deliberately left using the old names — dated historical record, not rewritten.

- **2026-07-18 · feat(tools) — CharGen and Live Sheet now show the anvil/hammer PACT favicon**: moved
  `assets/PACT_favicon.png` → `assets/icons/PACT_favicon.png` and added `<link rel="icon"
  type="image/png" href="../assets/icons/PACT_favicon.png">` to the two non-DM tools' `<head>` (right after
  the manifest link). DM Console deliberately left unchanged. Verified in a real browser: both tabs load the
  favicon (200) and DM Console has no icon link. Asset/display-only — no `DATA.version` or `BUILD` change.
- **2026-07-18 · feat(landing) — "Continue where you left off" recent-characters section**: `index.html`
  now shows resume cards for your last 3 distinct characters plus a collapsible timeline of the last 10
  autosaves, each resuming into the right tool via the existing `?handoff=` baton. Backed by a new shared
  versioned-autosave store in `js/character-store.js` (`recordAutosave`/`readRecent`, key `pactRecentV1`):
  both tools now additively feed it from their autosave (never touching their own restore slot, fully
  guarded). Capture uses time **and** difference — identical snapshots are skipped, rapid same-character
  edits coalesce, and a new snapshot is cut only on a ≥2-min gap, a tool switch, or a ≥5-event jump — so a
  keystroke burst can't fill it with duplicates. Character names render via `textContent` (XSS-safe). BUILD
  v0.201→v0.202; engine untouched (parity 20/0). See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-18-continue-recent-chars.
- **2026-07-18 · fix(chargen) — made CharGen's rules-version display read live from `DATA.version`**: 
  CharGen's header shows "PACT rules · vX" in both a `.hd-pactver` span and the `<title>` tag, but both 
  were hardcoded to v0.336 instead of reading `window.DATA.version` at `engine-ready` like Live Sheet 
  and DM Console already do. Added `id="cgPactver"` to the span and an event listener that updates both 
  the span text and the page title with the live version. Display-only — no rules/`compute()` change, 
  `DATA.version` unchanged. Mirrors the now-documented follow-up to the prior v0.332→v0.336 display-drift fix.

- **2026-07-18 · docs(agents) — refreshed stale version parentheticals in AGENTS.md**: The Versioning 
  section's "currently" notes for BUILD and DATA.version had drifted since PR #251: listed v0.107 
  and v0.332. Updated both to match the live values at merge time (real: v0.202 per js/engine.js — 
  bumped again since this PR was first opened, caught during its pre-merge rebase — and v0.336 per 
  js/engine-data.js). Docs-only — no code or rules change.
- **2026-07-18 · feat(theming) — extended localStorage-based theme switching to guide and DM Console**: 
  PACT-Players-Guide.html now supports the same 4-theme system as index.html (parchment/midnight/dragonfire/contrast) 
  with localStorage persistence. DM Console gained dark-mode support with system preference fallback, maintaining 
  its modern design language. CharGen and Live Sheet already had theme switching. Theming pattern now consistent 
  across all public-facing UIs.

- **2026-07-17 · fix(chargen) — synced CharGen's hardcoded rules-version display to the real
  `DATA.version`**: CharGen showed "Rules v0.332" (title + `.hd-pactver` header label + two doc comments)
  while the engine's canonical `DATA.version` had advanced to **v0.336** — a pre-existing display drift.
  Updated all four spots to v0.336. CharGen is the only tool that hardcodes this (Live Sheet and DM Console
  already read `DATA.version` live at `engine-ready`, so they can't drift); the misleading comment claiming
  the label "tracks DATA.version" was corrected to say it's hardcoded, and a follow-up to make CharGen
  live-read it too was noted. Display-only — no rules/`compute()` change, `DATA.version` untouched.

- **2026-07-17 · refactor(engine) — REV-14a: extracted the `DATA` rules dataset out of `js/engine.js`
  into its own `js/engine-data.js` module**: `engine.js` shrinks from ~189 KB (dominated by one 189 KB
  `DATA` literal line) to ~65 KB and now imports + re-exports `DATA` unchanged, so every tool/importer
  sees the identical surface — matching the existing `ap-by-level.js`/`advancement.js` externalization
  pattern. Byte-identical output verified: the moved literal is character-identical **and** deep-equal to
  the original, `engine-parity` (incl. warnings) reports **20/0**, and all 14 named exports are unchanged.
  `service-worker.js` updated (cache `pact-v5`→`pact-v6`, `engine-data.js` precached + network-first) so
  the rules dataset keeps `engine.js`'s immediate-fix-propagation semantics instead of going stale on a
  cache-first copy (see `DECISIONS.md`). No rules change — `DATA.version` unchanged (still v0.336); `BUILD`
  bumped **v0.200 → v0.201** (non-trivial structural build) and mirrored across the three tools per
  `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md`. Real-browser boot check (Chromium, all three tools): `engine-ready` fires, the
  bridges' `DATA` mutation succeeds (confirming `.js` is not frozen), and `compute()` runs clean. Follow-up
  **REV-14b** (split `compute()` into named sub-pricers) stays open; a cold-reviewed plan for the whole of
  REV-14 lives at `docs/plans/2026-07-17-engine-breakup-rev14.md`.

- **2026-07-17 · docs(roadmap) — scored `docs/TASK_BOARD.md`'s remaining untagged items with
  Effort/Risk tags**: REV-14, real icons, both landing-page follow-ups, A1/A3/A7's remaining scope, and
  the `MUT.patch` rename/restriction idea now carry the three-factor Risk breakdown, so they're visible
  to `/sweep-tasks` (most land at `Risk: high` — architectural/engine-touching or new live-data-table
  work — with real icons the one `Risk: low` exception, blocked only on art). The vague "Supporting
  reference tasks" bullets were deliberately left untagged — not scoped enough to rate. Also flagged
  (not fixed): A6's release-tagging work already shipped (v0.107) but was never marked done here.

- **2026-07-17 · fix(tooling) — `run-task.md`'s worktree-base check replaced with exact-equality, not
  ancestry**: the documented `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/preview HEAD` check (and an
  undocumented "sharper" ancestry variant used ad hoc this session) both give a false positive right
  after a `preview`→`main` promotion — a worktree wrongly based on `origin/main` still passes, since
  `origin/preview` is reachable from `main`'s tip via the promotion merge. Replaced with
  `[ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git rev-parse origin/preview)" ]`, which can't be fooled the same way.
  See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-17-worktree-base-check-exact-equality.

- **2026-07-17 · docs(tooling) — synced `docs/SKILLS.md` with the sweep-tasks/add-task changes it had
  missed**: the Ambiguity-High cross-tool-migration rule, `/sweep-tasks`' cap-backfill and stricter
  `$ARGUMENTS` parsing, and a corrected `/code-review ultra` description (it can silently fall back to
  a local max-effort pass, not always a billed cloud review).

- **2026-07-17 · refactor(auth) — shared `onSessionChange(session)` helper for `js/auth.js`,
  migrated 4 of 5 call sites**: adds `onSessionChange`, a one-argument wrapper around
  `onAuthChange(event, session)` that structurally rules out the argument-order bug — CharGen's 3
  call sites and DM Console's 1 (both previously bitten by it) now use it. Live Sheet's single call
  site (also previously bitten) keeps the raw, order-dependent `onAuthChange` since it genuinely
  needs the event string for its `SIGNED_OUT` branch — that site is **not** structurally protected by
  this change, only documented against (see `DECISIONS.md`). Display/UI-only, no `js/engine.js`/
  `DATA` involvement, parity still 20/0.

- **2026-07-17 · fix(tooling) — 15 findings from a `/code-review ultra` pass on `/sweep-tasks`/
  `/add-task` fixed**: worktree-leak on park paths, TaskList entries left stuck `in_progress`, no
  cap-backfill on drop/park, undefined bumped-to-high review tier, undefined PR-number capture,
  unvalidated `$ARGUMENTS` batch-size parsing, unguarded direct pushes to `preview`, a diff-size-check/
  add-task-example contradiction, a missing cross-tool-migration Ambiguity callout, plus stale-doc
  fixes in `docs/TASK_BOARD.md` and `AGENTS.md` — see `DECISIONS.md`
  D-GH-2026-07-17-sweep-tasks-review-fixes for the full list.

- **2026-07-16 · feat(tooling) — `/sweep-tasks` v2: three-factor Risk scoring + circuit breaker,
  diff-size check, risk-scaled review, sweep log**. Reworked Risk from a single holistic call into
  three named factors (ambiguity, damage scale, damage likelihood, each low/medium/high), worst-of
  combined — `Risk: high` is now an absolute veto with no exception, but `Risk: medium` is eligible
  (previously only `Risk: low` was). Effort no longer gates eligibility at all — it's used for queue
  ordering (low-effort-first tiebreak within each priority tier) and review-tier sizing, not
  filtering. Four new safety/observability additions to `/sweep-tasks`: (1) a consecutive-failure
  circuit breaker that halts the whole sweep after 2 failures in a row rather than grinding through a
  systemic problem; (2) a diff-size sanity check that flags (not auto-parks) a task whose real diff
  outgrew its Effort tag; (3) review tier now scales with the Risk tag itself (not just a
  js/engine.js/sql/ file-path proxy), plus a required live-verification step for anything above
  `Risk: low`; (4) a new `docs/sweep-log.md`, appended every run, recording what was *attempted* —
  not just what shipped, which `CHANGELOG.md` alone can't show. Re-scored the 2 tasks already tagged
  on the board under the fuller model: the engine-review cleanup batch moved from `medium` to `Risk:
  high` (item 4's ambiguity was under-weighted in the first pass — still never eligible either way),
  the shared `onAuthChange` wrapper moved from `low` to `Risk: medium` (no automated gate for
  auth-UI regressions — still eligible, now correctly flagged as needing live verification).
  `/code-review` caught 2 real bugs in the new step ordering before merge: the review-fix re-entry
  section had picked up a stray, misapplied worktree-base check that would have run `git reset
  --hard origin/preview` *after* a fix was already committed — discarding it — and the live/real
  verification requirement was sequenced before the code-review fix step, so a task that needed a
  fix would have its Risk-tier verification checked against the pre-fix code, not what actually
  merges. Both fixed: the stray check removed (redundant — the existing reset-to-origin/<branch>
  step already covers it), and live verification moved to run last, against the final code. See
  `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-16-sweep-tasks-risk-model-v2.

- **2026-07-16 · feat(tooling) — add `/sweep-tasks`, the unattended batch version of pick→run→review→merge**.
  New `.claude/commands/sweep-tasks.md` loops over every roadmap task tagged `Effort: low|medium` **and**
  `Risk: low`, running each through `/run-task` → `/code-review` → merge with no per-task confirmation
  (merge-as-you-go is a fixed default, not a per-run prompt). Any newly-surfaced task discovered mid-sweep
  gets added to the board in `/add-task`'s format — deliberately skipping that skill's normal
  clarify/approval-wait steps, since this skill is unattended by design — and folds into the same run if
  it also clears the bar. Asks once, up front, how many tasks to attempt; nothing else is interactive.
  Never promotes `preview`→`main`. `/add-task` gained matching `**Effort:**`/`**Risk:**` classification
  criteria (with worked examples) so the two skills stay in sync on what counts as safe to run unattended.
  Retrofitted the 2 currently-open roadmap tasks with tags as a first real testbed: the engine-review
  cleanup batch is `medium`/`medium` (touches `js/engine.js`, not eligible), the shared `onAuthChange`
  wrapper is `medium`/`low` (mechanical UI-only refactor, eligible). `/code-review` caught 4 real gaps
  in the skill's own procedural instructions before it ever ran: the review-fix re-entry sequence had
  no fallback for a stale local branch already holding the target name (hit twice in today's manual
  session), the fix-loop's rebase had no defined behavior on a real conflict (unlike `/run-task`'s own
  "stop and flag" rule), the frontmatter advertised a `[difficulty/topic filter]` argument Step 2 never
  implemented, and "merge once checks pass" referenced a CI check nothing in the skill ever queried.
  All four fixed before merge. See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-16-sweep-tasks-skill.

- **2026-07-16 · ci(lighthouse) — add Lighthouse CI to auto-catch landing-page regressions**.
  New `.github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml` runs Lighthouse (desktop preset, via
  `treosh/lighthouse-ci-action`) against `index.html` on PRs touching it or its assets — served
  locally (no deploy needed) by exploiting `actions/checkout`'s default path already ending in a
  directory named after the repo, so serving its parent reproduces the `/PACT/` URL prefix the
  manifest/service-worker expect, no symlink needed. Thresholds in the new `lighthouserc.json` are
  set from a real measured baseline (2026-07-16, desktop: performance 100, accessibility 98-100
  across runs, best-practices 96, seo 100), not an arbitrary target — 0.85 floor gives headroom for
  Lighthouse's normal run-to-run variance while still catching a real regression;
  performance/accessibility gate the build (error), best-practices/seo are advisory (warn).
  Achieving the higher "Lighthouse 85→90" target via engine splitting/lazy-loading stays deferred
  (bigger, riskier change, only after REV-01 matures) — this PR is just the auto-catch mechanism.
  Verified end-to-end locally (`@lhci/cli` against a real served copy): passes cleanly today, and a
  forced-impossible threshold correctly fails with exit code 1 and a readable per-category report.
  `/code-review` caught a real gap: the local-server readiness poll never failed if the server
  didn't come up in time, so a broken server would silently fall through to an opaque Lighthouse
  connection error instead of a clear message — fixed to `exit 1` with the server's own log on
  timeout. Verified both the success and forced-failure paths directly.

- **2026-07-16 · feat(index) — dismissible "Add to Home Screen" hint for iOS Safari**.
  `beforeinstallprompt` never fires on iOS Safari, so the existing "Install app" button (Chromium/
  Android/desktop only) never appeared there and iOS visitors had no install path at all. Added a
  `.ios-hint` bottom bar shown only via a genuine feature-detect (`'standalone' in navigator` — a
  nonstandard property only iOS Safari defines, not UA-sniffing per H-015), hidden again if already
  installed (`navigator.standalone === true` or `display-mode: standalone`). Dismissible; remembers
  dismissal in `localStorage` so it doesn't nag every visit. Verified in a real (spoofed-UA) browser:
  shows for iOS-not-installed, stays hidden for already-installed and non-iOS, dismiss removes it and
  persists across reload, no console errors in any case. `/code-review` caught a real collision:
  `.ios-hint` and the pre-existing service-worker `.update-bar` are both `position:fixed;bottom:0`, so
  an update detected mid-session would render on top of and hide the install hint — fixed by having
  the update bar remove any visible `.ios-hint` when it appears (an update takes precedence; the hint
  simply re-evaluates and can reappear after the reload). Verified live (simulated the exact update-bar
  creation code path against a page with `.ios-hint` already showing). See `DECISIONS.md`

- **2026-07-16 · chore(ci) — static check: SECURITY DEFINER functions must set search_path with pg_temp**.
  Adds `check_sql_security_definer_search_path()` to `testing/scripts/audit.py`, making yesterday's
  retroactive `pg_temp` hardening (D-GH-2026-07-16-harden-search-path-pg-temp) durable — a future
  `SECURITY DEFINER` function written without copying an existing one would previously reopen the gap
  with nothing to catch it. Scans `sql/schema.sql`/`sql/rls-policies.sql` for `security definer` function
  declarations (comment lines excluded, fixed after an initial false-positive run against `-- ... SECURITY
  DEFINER ...` doc comments) and fails if `search_path` is missing `pg_temp` or missing entirely. Wired
  into `.github/workflows/static-audit.yml`'s trigger paths (which didn't previously include either SQL
  file, so this check — and the whole audit — would never have run on a PR touching them). Verified: passes
  clean against current state (27/0), and correctly fails when a `pg_temp` clause is reverted (tested by
  simulating and then restoring the regression).

- **2026-07-16 · fix(sql) — harden `search_path` on all 16 `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with `pg_temp`**.
  Every `SECURITY DEFINER` function in `sql/schema.sql`/`sql/rls-policies.sql` set `search_path = public`
  without also listing `pg_temp`, leaving the classic session-local-temp-table-shadowing gap open
  repo-wide (low real-world exploitability today — Supabase/PostgREST clients have no raw-SQL/DDL path —
  but worth closing consistently rather than piecemeal). Changed all 16 to
  `search_path = public, pg_temp` via `ALTER FUNCTION` (not a full body redeclaration, to avoid the
  schema.sql-vs-migration drift risk found earlier today). Applied live and verified: all 16 functions'
  `proconfig` now shows the new value, `gen_invite_code()`/`is_campaign_dm()` still resolve correctly,
  Supabase security advisor unchanged (same pre-existing/accepted warnings, no new findings), parity
  20/0. See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-16-harden-search-path-pg-temp.

- **2026-07-16 · chore(sw) — widen network-first to cover auth/sync/campaign/dm client modules**.
  `service-worker.js`'s `NETWORK_FIRST_RE` covered only `*.html`/`/PACT/`/`js/engine.js`; `js/auth.js`,
  `js/supabase-client.js`, `js/sync.js`, `js/campaign.js`, `js/dm.js` were cache-first, so a client-side
  fix to any of them didn't reach a returning offline-capable user until the SW updated *and* they
  reloaded twice. Widened the regex to include these 5 modules — the network-first fetch handler already
  falls back to the cached copy on failure, so this costs nothing in offline capability, only speeds up
  fix propagation (the exact class of bug DM Console's `onAuthChange` fix earlier today would otherwise
  be slow to reach). `CACHE_NAME` bumped `pact-v4`→`pact-v5` per this repo's convention. See `DECISIONS.md`

- **2026-07-16 · fix(sql) — schema-qualify `gen_random_bytes()` calls, fixing campaign/invite creation**.
  `gen_invite_code()` and `create_player_invite()` called bare `gen_random_bytes(...)`, but pgcrypto's
  `gen_random_bytes` lives in the `extensions` schema on this project, not `public` (which their
  `search_path` was pinned to) — so campaign creation and player-invite creation were broken everywhere
  in the deployed app (zero campaign rows existed anywhere). Fixed by schema-qualifying the calls
  (`extensions.gen_random_bytes(...)`) rather than widening `search_path`, to avoid broadening what these
  `SECURITY DEFINER` functions can implicitly resolve. Verified live: a real `INSERT INTO campaigns`
  (the app's actual code path) now succeeds via `gen_invite_code()`'s column default, and
  `extensions.gen_random_bytes(16)` — the exact expression `create_player_invite()` uses — resolves
  correctly. See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH-2026-07-16-campaign-invite-search-path.

- **2026-07-16 · fix(dm-console) — guard `updateAuth()` against reloading the roster on every auth event**.
  The `onAuthChange` argument-order fix earlier in this PR removed a crash that was accidentally masking
  `updateAuth()` calling `loadCampaigns()`→`loadRoster()` unconditionally on every truthy-session auth
  event, including hourly `TOKEN_REFRESHED` — wiping the roster table's HTML (and any in-progress
  award-amount/note input a DM was mid-typing) for no reason. Added the same `wasSignedIn`/`nowSignedIn`
  sign-in-transition guard `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`'s `updateAuth` already uses, so the roster
  only reloads on an actual sign-in, not on token housekeeping. Found by `/code-review` on this PR.

  Drove a real signed-in DM and a real signed-in player through the full round-trip (Playwright, real
  Supabase auth/DB, no stubbing): DM Console's three Campaign Rules controls render and live-preview
  correctly, preset↔field sync works, saved rules persist in `campaigns.rules` across reload, the
  player-invite "Starting budget" field pre-fills from Starting tier and stays editable, and a
  campaign-bound character's Live Sheet header shows a tuned "≈ Track-Level N" that genuinely diverges
  from an unbound character's Standard-curve label at the same AP spend. Fixed a real bug found along the
  way: `tools/DM-Console.html`'s `onAuthChange` callback bound `session` to the event string instead of
  the session object (same bug already fixed in Live Sheet/CharGen), crashing `updateAuth()` on every
  auth-state change. Filed, not fixed here (bigger blast radius than this task's scope): `campaigns` and
  `campaign_invites` cannot currently be created anywhere in the deployed app because
  `gen_random_bytes()` isn't schema-qualified/on the `search_path` in `sql/schema.sql`'s `SECURITY
  DEFINER` functions — moot today only because no tool UI calls `createCampaign()` yet either. See

  footer label, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`,
  `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, all five `.claude/commands/*.md`, and the forward-pointer

- **2026-07-16 · chore(tools) — unify the duplicated "AP-vs-threshold → level" scan into one shared
  `levelForThreshold()` helper** (`js/ui-helpers.js` + `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`,
  `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; no engine/`DATA.version` change). The
  identical "highest level L whose per-level threshold ≤ value" loop lived in three places (CharGen's
  fixed-ladder `apLevel`, Live Sheet's + DM Console's tuned-curve `trackLevel`). Extracted the loop once
  into `levelForThreshold(value, thresholdAt)` in the existing shared `js/ui-helpers.js` (per the
  D-GH-2026-07-14 shared-helpers precedent — not `js/engine.js`, keeping its API untouched); each tool's
  `apLevel`/`trackLevel` is now a thin wrapper passing its own threshold source (fixed `DATA.levelAP`
  ladder vs. `l1+inc*(L-1)` curve), so call sites and behaviour are unchanged. CharGen's fixed-ladder
  concept stays distinct — only the scan is shared, not the threshold. Verified: 147/147 old-vs-new

  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; UI-only,
  no engine/rules/`DATA.version` change). Each tool's header now carries a consistent, unobtrusive
  `.homelink` ("← Home" → `../index.html`), placed in the always-visible row so it survives on mobile
  (CharGen `.hd-row1`, Live Sheet `.top`, DM Console `.topbar`). Added `aria-label`s to the icon-only
  buttons touched: DM Console's three `×`/`✕` remove/close buttons (was 0 aria-labels), plus the mobile
  undo/redo (`↶`/`↷`) in Live Sheet's `#lmobar` and CharGen's `.hd-mobnav`. Button-clutter audit found the
  desktop/mobile toolbars are responsive-exclusive (swapped by media query), not duplicated, and the DM
  Console view toggles are distinct functions — so no buttons were removed (would have dropped reachable
  functionality); the cleanup is the Home link + labels. Also gave Live Sheet's fixed `#apFloat` "AP left"
  badge `pointer-events:none` — the Home link reflowed the `.top` header so "Open in CharGen" landed under
  that always-on overlay, which was intercepting the click (caught by the browser e2e job); the badge is a
  read-only readout with no handlers, so click-through is the correct fix and also removes the latent
  overlap hazard for any future header control.

  `DATA.levelAP` ladder** (`tools/DM-Console.html` only; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change).
  The roster's per-character level (card "Level N", detail "AP-level") now resolves the DM-tuned
  level-budget curve carried in each character's own LOG (`rulesSnapshot` event), via a DM-Console-local
  `_latestLogSnapshotRules()`/`_levelCurve()`/`trackLevel()` trio that mirrors Live Sheet's — so the
  roster agrees with what that character's Live Sheet shows, tuned or not. The fixed `DATA.levelAP` ladder
  is no longer read for level *display* here (the old `apLevel()` function was removed). **Behavior note:**
  because Live Sheet already retired the fixed ladder in favour of the Standard preset (`{l1:79,inc:24}`)
  for untuned/unbound characters, DM Console now falls back to that same Standard curve too — so an
  unbound character's displayed roster level can shift versus the old ladder, by design, to match Live
  Sheet. See `DECISIONS.md` (`D-GH-2026-07-15-dm-console-roster-tuned-curve`).

  CharGen, Live Sheet, DM Console, and the Player's Guide, inserting into a new insert-only `feedback`
  table (read only via the Supabase dashboard — no in-app admin view in v1). The widget module depends
  only on the shared Supabase client — no `engine-ready`/`ui-helpers.js` coupling — so it drops onto the
  Player's Guide (which had zero prior JS/module wiring) with one `<script type="module">` tag.
  Signed-out users submit anonymously; signed-in users are attributed unless they tick "submit
  anonymously." Guardrails: DB-level `page` enum + message (1–2000) / contact (≤200) length checks, a
  client-side ~60s cooldown, double-submit lock, and clear offline/failure UX. **First table to grant the

  change, parity 20/0). `expected-results.csv`'s `new_engine_warnings` previously asserted only a
  **count** per fixture — a warning changing wording, firing for the wrong reason, or silently
  disappearing while another appeared wouldn't fail the gate. Each of the 20 fixtures' exact
  warning-text array is now asserted (order-sensitive deep equality); verified the check actually
  catches a mismatch by temporarily corrupting one expected entry (confirmed FAIL), then restored it.
  Removed the now-redundant CG-003/CG-007 hardcoded first-warning-text checks (subsumed by the general
  array check) while keeping their still-independent `remaining`-sign assertions. New data lives in a
  JSON sidecar rather than a new CSV column — one real warning (LS-001's Ki-focus message) contains a
  literal comma, which the harnesses' naive `line.split(',')` CSV parser can't handle safely; see
  `D-GH-2026-07-15-parity-warning-text-assertions` in `DECISIONS.md`. This is the documented
  precondition REV-14 (splitting `compute()`'s `W.push`-site body) was waiting on — the split itself is
  still a separate, not-yet-started task. Coverage note: only 5 of the engine's 54 `W.push` sites (plus
  the separate over-budget `W.unshift`) are exercised by the current 20 fixtures — a real but pre-existing

  `esc()` three times with three different escaping rules (one dropped quote-escaping entirely, none
  escaped single quotes); CharGen and DM Console each had their own separate copy too. `flash()` and the
  3-tier `_csCopy()` fallback (Clipboard API → `execCommand` textarea → `window.prompt`) were duplicated
  verbatim between CharGen and Live Sheet. Removed all local copies (including two nested shadows inside
  the `_spellAC()` autocomplete widget, itself duplicated between CharGen and Live Sheet) in favor of one
  canonical `esc()` that escapes `& < > " '`, and removed Live Sheet's now-redundant static `#flash` div.
  Left each tool's `setTheme()` local — its `localStorage` line is one-line-duplicated but the surrounding
  DOM-sync logic differs per tool, so a shared extraction wasn't worth the indirection. DM Console's own
  clipboard-copy pattern (button-text feedback + `execCommand` fallback) is a different shape, not a
  duplicate, so it was left as-is. Verified in a real browser: all three tools resolve `esc`/`flash`/
  `_csCopy` as globals with correct escaping/behavior, no console errors introduced.

  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; no `js/engine.js`/`DATA.version`/`BUILD` change, parity 20/0).
  From an independent multi-angle review of the same-day eco-line unification PR (#210), fixed 4 issues
  the review confirmed: (1) `render()` was resolving the DM-tuned level curve up to 3x per call (the eco
  line resolved it twice, the header a third time) via a `resolveRules()` path that can be an O(LOG)
  backward scan, and `render()` fires continuously with no debounce while the time-travel slider is
  dragged — `trackLevel()` now takes an optional pre-resolved curve, resolved once per render and reused
  by all three call sites (verified 3→1 `resolveRules()` calls per render); (2) `_levelCurve()`'s
  `+bc.l1||79`/`+bc.inc||24` silently discarded an explicit DM-tuned `0`, now honoured via `!=null` checks;
  (3) a zero/negative DM-tuned `inc` broke `trackLevel()`'s monotonic-threshold assumption and could
  return a near-top level for very little AP — `inc` is now floored to 1; (4) the eco line's "top level"
  fallback used a bare truthy check on `nx`, which a DM-tuned curve could make legitimately `0` for a
  non-top level — changed to `nx!=null`. Two other review findings (DM Console's roster still reading the
  untuned fixed ladder; the same "AP vs threshold table → level" loop duplicated across 3 tool files) were
  left as follow-up roadmap items rather than fixed here — both are cross-tool/architectural, not confined
  to this file.

  Track-Level** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; no `js/engine.js`/`DATA.version`/`BUILD` change,
  parity 20/0). The `#eco` block's "Lv" chip computed level-equivalence from `eco.earned` against the
  fixed `DATA.levelAP` ladder, while the header's `≈ Track-Level` used `eco.spent` against the campaign's
  DM-tuned `levelBudgetCurve` (feat/advancement-tracks, PR #206) — two different curves, so the numbers
  could silently disagree for the same character. Extracted `_levelCurve()` out of `trackLevel()` and had
  the eco line call `trackLevel(eco.earned)` instead of its own inline fixed-ladder loop, relabelled
  "Lv" → "Earned Lv" with a tooltip distinguishing it from Track-Level. Now the two readouts can only
  differ by spent-vs-earned AP, never by which curve is in effect. See

  (Slow 5 / Average 7 / Fast 10 AP/session), `DATA.startingTierRatios` (Prelude 0.7× … Legendary 1.6×) —
  none read by `compute()` or `_replay()`. DM Console's Campaign Rules panel gained three controls (preset
  + editable numbers, live L20 preview, preset↔field sync), persisted into the existing `campaigns.rules`
  JSONB via `setCampaignRules` (no new column/RPC/RLS); the player-invite "Starting budget" field now
  pre-fills from the campaign's starting tier (editable per invite). Live Sheet's header/overlay "≈ AP-Level"
  chip (earned-AP vs the fixed default table) was **replaced** by "≈ Track-Level" (AP *spent* vs the
  campaign's tuned budget curve, Standard fallback when unbound); the now-orphaned `apLevel()` helper was
  removed from Live Sheet. Dropped from the original roadmap task: the "D&D 2024 equivalent" label (the
  existing "Level N" already IS that per the guide's identity rule — a redundant chip); deferred: custom
  per-level curve UI and the `DATA.level1AP` creation-lock coherence fix (a real mechanics change, its own
  PR). Graduates the "Advancement tracks + D&D 2024 level equivalency" roadmap item. See `DECISIONS.md`
  `D-GH-2026-07-14-advancement-tracks`.
- **2026-07-14 · feat(docs) — `docs/roadmap.html`: a standalone visual roadmap interface** (new file;
  no `js/engine.js` change, no `DATA.version` bump, parity unaffected 20/0). A self-contained, vanilla-JS
  single page (no build step, no dependencies — same static/GitHub-Pages ethos as the tools) that renders
  both open work (from `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`) and shipped history (207 entries parsed from
  `CHANGELOG.md`) in seven interchangeable views: **Board** (Now/Next/Later/Shipped columns), **Timeline**
  (planned + shipped-per-day), **Category**, **Priority** swimlanes, a graphical radial **Map**
  (mind-map clustering items around category hubs around a PACT center), a sortable **Table**, and a
  **Dashboard** (delivery-cadence bar chart, by-category/status/priority breakdowns, at-a-glance stats).
  A shared control bar (text search + status/category/priority filters) drives every view live; clicking
  any item opens a detail dialog. Theme-aware (light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme` + a manual toggle),
  responsive, all player-facing text run through `esc()`. The data is a point-in-time snapshot embedded in
  the page; regenerate by re-parsing the two source docs when it drifts.

  refactor: `join_campaign`, `redeem_player_invite`, and `bind_character_to_campaign` each hand-rolled
  their own "look up campaign by shared `invite_code`" (`join_campaign`/`bind_character_to_campaign` only)
  and "already joined this campaign" (all three) checks — flagged by two independent `/code-review ultra`
  angles (Reuse, Altitude) on PR #202 and deferred at the time. The lookup is now one new helper,
  `find_campaign_by_invite_code`; the membership check reuses the pre-existing `is_campaign_member()`
  rather than adding a second near-identical function (a `/code-review` pass on this PR itself caught that
  duplication before merge). No error messages or behavior changed — verified against a live smoke test
  and the Supabase advisor. See `DECISIONS.md` `D-GH-2026-07-13-campaign-membership-helpers` for detail,
  including two findings deferred as separate follow-ups (a pre-existing race-handling asymmetry between
  the three RPCs, and a `search_path` hardening gap shared by every `SECURITY DEFINER` function in the file).

  flow.md`'s two-deliverable split (Deliverable 1/Path A shipped above). New `bind_character_to_campaign`
  SECURITY DEFINER RPC reuses the campaign's existing shared `invite_code` (not Path A's per-player
  token) to bind an *already-built* character — the rebind contract enforces bind-only-if-unbound,
  same-campaign-is-a-no-op, different-campaign-is-rejected, and one-character-per-player-per-campaign,
  all server-side. CharGen's ☁ Cloud menu gets a "Join campaign" action (placed there rather than the
  header's campaign-rules picker, which is a display-only preview independent of any specific character
  — see the plan's Revision 4 note): saves the current character to the cloud first if needed, binds it,
  then runs the engine's `validate(build, rules)` and shows any violations as non-blocking warnings — the
  character stays bound regardless, since an independently-built character may carry pre-campaign
  "violations" a hard refusal would make unfixable. Reuses the `_cgResolveDmApStatus()` helper built for
  Path A to activate DM-AP display and rule-filtering. Supabase advisor shows no new class of finding.

- **2026-07-13 · fix(campaign) — `/code-review ultra` pass on the bind-character PR fixed a race and a
  stale-display bug before merge** (same files as the entry above). `bind_character_to_campaign` had a
  TOCTOU race in its one-character-per-player-per-campaign check (shared with the already-shipped
  `join_campaign`/`redeem_player_invite`) — closed with a `unique index on characters(owner_id,
  campaign_id) where campaign_id is not null`, authoritative for all three functions at once. The join
  flow's success message/rule validation could read the wrong campaign (`window._cloudCampaign` is also
  written by the unrelated rules-preview picker) — fixed by having `_cgResolveDmApStatus()` return the
  freshly-resolved campaign for callers to use locally instead of trusting the shared global. Also: the
  RPC now returns the bound campaign id directly (was `void`, forcing an extra round-trip); the
  "already bound" banner no longer offers a "switch campaigns" action that always fails; an offline save
  is now detected before attempting the bind instead of surfacing a confusing raw network error. See
  `DECISIONS.md` `D-GH-2026-07-13-campaign-bind-character` for the full list.

  `join_campaign()` existed as a tested RPC with zero production UI and no way to preset a starting
  budget; this ships the first of two onboarding paths from `docs/plans/2026-07-11-campaign-join-
  invite-flow.md` (Revision 3). New `campaign_invites` table + `create_player_invite`/
  `redeem_player_invite` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (single-use, CSPRNG token, idempotent redemption for
  double-click/crash recovery, one-character-per-player-per-campaign enforced server-side). DM
  Console gets an "Invite new player" action generating a canonical CharGen link. CharGen detects
  `?invite=<token>`, stashes it in `sessionStorage` across a `login.html` sign-in round-trip (that
  redirect-back hook is new in `login.html` too), confirms with the player, then redeems it into a
  brand-new campaign-bound `chargen` character pre-seeded with the DM-set starting AP/budget —
  reusing CharGen's own `_cgEnvelope`/`_cgApplyEnvelope` cloud-save helpers and DM-AP-status
  resolution pattern (shipped in the `feat/campaign-ap-model` change below) rather than re-deriving
  either. Path B (binding an *existing* built character to a campaign) is a separate, still-open
  deliverable — see `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`. Supabase advisor shows no new class of finding (the two
  new RPCs carry the same "authenticated can execute this SECURITY DEFINER function" WARN as all 11
  pre-existing campaign RPCs — the app's intended design). Full plan + design decisions:

  data-loss bug before merge** (same files as the entry above, plus `login.html`). `redeem_player_invite`
  now attempts its atomic claim before checking idempotency (a same-user double-click could previously
  race and error instead of recovering); the client now only re-seeds a character on a genuinely fresh
  redemption (`is_new`, new RPC return field) instead of unconditionally overwriting `stats` on every
  redemption — a double-tab or retry was silently wiping real progress back to a bare budget award.
  Also: a stale pending-invite token could hijack an unrelated later sign-in in `login.html`; the
  redemption listener re-fired on every `onAuthChange` event including hourly token refreshes; a NULL
  argument could bypass `create_player_invite`'s sign check; `js/campaign.js`'s `| 0` coercion could
  silently wrap huge inputs; the DM-AP-status resolution logic duplicated between CharGen's cloud-load
  flow and the redemption flow is now one shared helper. See `DECISIONS.md`

- **2026-07-13 · fix — `compute()`: `NaN` in a low-ability-score caster's known-spell over-cap
  surcharge (`DATA.version` v0.335 → v0.336)** (`js/engine.js` only). Found by `log-fuzz.mjs`
  (below) on its first run: the known-spell cap (`dmod+hd`) can go negative for a caster with a
  very low spellcasting-ability modifier and low HD (e.g. INT 5 → mod -3, HD 1 → cap -2). A
  negative cap makes `knownTotal>knownCap` fire even at 0 spells known, and the over-cap
  surcharge loop (`for(let i=0;i<over;i++)sur+=knownUnits[i]`) then reads past the end of an
  empty array, producing `NaN` in `discInfo[].cost`/breakdown (display-only — `total`/`remaining`
  were unaffected, since the `NaN`'d surcharge fails an `if(knownAP)` guard before it would
  otherwise reach the running total). Fixed by flooring the cap at 0
  (`Math.max(0,dmod+hd)`) — also fixes a bogus "spells known over cap" warning that fired at 0
  known spells whenever the cap was negative. Verified: `engine-parity` still 20/0 (no fixture
  hits this edge case), `log-fuzz.mjs` clean across 15,000+ iterations / 5 seeds (was reliably
  failing every ~2000-3000 iterations before the fix). `log-fuzz.mjs` now wired into CI
  (`.github/workflows/engine-parity.yml`, a new `log-fuzz` job) now that it's green.
- **2026-07-13 · test — `log-fuzz.mjs`: a pure-Node, LOG-direct fuzzer for `js/engine.js`**
  (Phase 2 of the D-GH-2026-07-13-random-e2e-real-oracle plan; `testing/scripts/log-fuzz.mjs`,
  `testing/README.md`, `testing/package.json`). `random-manual-e2e.mjs` (Phase 1) drives the
  real browser UI, so it can only reach LOG shapes a DOM click path can produce; this harness
  constructs LOG event objects directly against `MUT`'s documented shape (`{type:'buy',
  cat:<key>,payload:{...}}` across all 44 mutation categories, plus `award`/`buyoff`/`name`/
  `names`/`creationLocked`/`campaignBound`) and feeds them straight into `foldBuild()`/
  `compute()`/`rebuildStateFromEvents()` — no browser, so it runs thousands of iterations in a
  couple of seconds (verified: 2000-3000 iterations in ~1-2s). Checks: never throws (including a
  non-deterministic throw on a 3rd equivalent `compute()` call), never produces `NaN` anywhere
  across every object it computes, `compute()` doesn't mutate its input, `foldBuild()` purity,
  `compute()` purity (Phase 1's check, reused), and `foldBuild()+compute()` agreement
  with `rebuildStateFromEvents(null, LOG)` on `.result`. Shrinks any failure to a minimal
  reproducer (single-event delta-debug). **Its first run found a real bug** (see the next
  entry) — not yet wired into CI pending that fix landing separately (`js/engine.js` is
  high-risk; kept out of this tool-only change). No `DATA.version` bump (test-only).
- **2026-07-13 · fix — CharGen: species-choosable size + lineage clobbered on Live Sheet → CharGen
  handoff** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `applyBuild()` only). A Tiefling (or any species with a
  choosable size) that round-tripped Live Sheet → CharGen lost its "Medium" choice back to "Small".
  Root cause: `applyBuild()` writes DOM controls, then calls `render()` — but at that point `LOG`
  hasn't been resynced from the DOM yet (that resync runs later in the same function), so `render()`
  computes off stale, previous-build `LOG` data. A stale species can make `sizeChoosable` wrongly
  false, which triggers the size block's one-way destructive `cs.value='Small'` reset — and nothing
  ever restores it once the species becomes correct again. `applyBuild()` already re-asserts several
  other fields (`spec`/`spec2`/`oclass`/`oclass2`/`hd`/`profBonus`/`budget`) in a block *after*
  `render()` specifically to fix this class of clobbering; `charsize` was simply missing from that
  list. Added it. Caught by the widened tool-switch field diff in `random-manual-e2e.mjs` (2026-07-13,
  below) during CI on the preview→main promotion PR — the harness's previous 3-field diff never
  looked at `size`. A code review of the fix found a second, identically-shaped instance: a species
  with lineages (Elf, etc.) that round-tripped the same way could have its chosen lineage silently
  blanked, since `lineage` was set once (before `render()`) but likewise never re-asserted. Added
  `lineage` to the same re-assert block. No `DATA.version` bump (UI-only, no `compute()` output
  change); `engine-parity.html`/`engine-parity-ci.mjs` still 20/0.
- **2026-07-13 · test — `random-manual-e2e.mjs`: a genuinely independent oracle, not just a
  self-check** (`testing/scripts/random-manual-e2e.mjs` only). Every tool bridges the SAME
  `js/engine.js` onto `window`, so the harness's prior checks ("displayed AP == `economy().available`")
  were self-referential — a bug in `compute()`/`economy()` itself would pass, since every UI surface
  agrees on the wrong number together. Added four checks that don't have that blind spot, run against
  the real random LOG each iteration generates (not just the 20 static parity fixtures): **(1)**
  Node-vs-browser agreement — the same `engine.js` freshly imported into this Node process, fed the
  browser's real LOG, must match `economy()`/`compute(foldBuild())`; **(2)** dual-entry-point
  agreement — `foldBuild()+compute()` vs `rebuildStateFromEvents()` must agree with each other;
  **(3)** a hand-written, spec-derived LOG-cost reconciliation (not calling `economy()`) — the one
  check that can catch a bug in `economy()`'s own categorization logic, since (1)/(2) would both
  reproduce that bug identically; **(4)** `compute()` purity (same input twice → same output, input
  untouched). Also replaced the tool-switch round-trip check's 3 hand-picked fields
  (species/originClass/hd) with a curated ~20-field diff, and added a previously-entirely-unchecked
  **undo/redo round-trip identity** check in Live Sheet advancement. Verified with two positive
  controls (a temporary `_spendCost()` doubling bug, and a temporary `redo()` drop bug) — both caught
  immediately and precisely by the new checks, then reverted; zero false positives across ~10 clean
  runs against the real app. Fixed a real bug found while building this: `checkEconomyAgreement`
  initially called `window.economy(LOG)` uniformly, but Live Sheet shadows `window.economy` with a
  local INDEX-based wrapper (for its time-travel/scrub UI) — passing an array where an index is
  expected silently replayed an empty LOG. Fixed to resolve the raw array-parameter engine function
  per tool (`window._engineFold` on Live Sheet, `window` directly on CharGen).
- **2026-07-13 · feat — back up / restore all local data from the landing page (A5)** (`index.html`;
  localStorage-only, no engine/schema touch). A "Your data" section on `index.html` bundles every `pact*`
  localStorage key (Live Sheet character, CharGen build, DM roster, settings — all same-origin) into one
  downloadable JSON, and restores from it, so signed-out/local-only play survives a browser or cache clear.
  Restore **whitelists `pact*` string keys** (a file can't write arbitrary storage) and confirms before
  overwriting. Verified in a real browser (7/7), including the whitelist rejecting a malicious non-`pact` key.
- **2026-07-13 · refactor(engine) — remove REV-13 dead grant maps** (`js/engine.js`; no `DATA.version` bump,
  parity 20/0). `compute()`'s `grantSk/grantTl/grantIn` "free-grant" scaffolds were declared empty and never
  populated, so the paid-skill/tool filters that read them (`filter(s=>!grantSk[s])` …) only ever filtered an
  empty set — every proficiency was already counted as paid. Removed the maps and simplified the filters to
  their equivalent no-grant form (`.length`). Byte-identical output, so no REV-01 baseline change. If a future
  feature grants free proficiencies, reintroduce the filter with a fixture that exercises it.
- **2026-07-13 · chore/docs — low-risk hardening batch (B1/B4/B5/B3)** (no `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0, e2e green):
  - **B5** — pinned `supabase-js` to exact **2.110.2** (was the `@2` major) in `js/supabase-client.js`, so a CDN
    minor/patch can't silently change offline/auth behaviour; the e2e stub route became a version-agnostic
    regex so it keeps intercepting across future pin bumps. (SW never intercepts the CDN — unaffected.)
  - **B1** — replaced the stale partial "Exports:" block atop `js/engine.js` with a full **API contract**
    (all 14 exports: signature + return shape + one-liner, grouped by concern), so agents grasp the API
    without reading the ~238 KB body.
  - **B4** — added a **one-line-per-decision index** (68 entries) to the top of `DECISIONS.md`.
  - **B3** — added a **global error surface** (`error`/`unhandledrejection` → console with a `[PACT]` marker +
    Report-issue URL, never swallowed) to all four pages, plus a visible **"Report an issue"** link in the
    footers that have one (index + DM Console).

  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html` only; `js/engine.js` untouched, no `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0).
  A bound character now keeps a copy of its campaign's restriction rules in its own event LOG (a
  `rulesSnapshot` event that is **inert to the engine** — `_spendCost()`→0, `_replay()` skips non-`buy`,
  verified no AP/build/economy effect), so the bans still apply offline or when the cloud rules are
  momentarily unreachable. New `resolveRules()` returns the LIVE cloud rules when online-in-campaign
  (authoritative) else the latest LOG snapshot else null; `cloudRuleBarred()` and the multi-discipline
  check now funnel through it. The snapshot is refreshed from live rules on sync/load (deduped — no LOG
  churn) and **cleared with a logged event** when the character is confirmed standalone (leave/clone), so
  a left campaign stops applying stale bans. `undo()` drops trailing snapshot metadata (re-materialized on
  next sync) so it never blocks undoing a real action; the ledger hides snapshot rows (still audit-visible
  in the raw LOG/export). `b.houseRules` (#2) untouched. Verified: engine-inertness (Node) + resolver logic
  (Chromium, 18/18) + `random-manual-e2e` 2/2. Why in `DECISIONS.md`

  **no `DATA.version` bump**, engine-parity **20/0**). Removed the redundant client-trusted "House rules
  code" feature now that DM-authoritative cloud rules (`validate()`/`RULE_BAN_FIELDS`, incl.
  bannedDrawbacks/bannedArts since PR #174) cover it server-side. Deleted: `MUT.campaign`/`b.campaign`/the
  `cat:'campaign'` event, the `_campEnc`/`_campDec` `PACTRULES:` codec, `campBarred` + the "🛡 House rules
  code"/"🛡 Campaign" UI and its `campchip`/`campind` display in both tools, the dead `PATCH_SLOTS.CAMPAIGN`
  key, and the `"campaign": null` field from 6 CG build fixtures. **Kept** (surgical splits): the cloud
  `cloudRuleBarred()`/`RULE_BAN_FIELDS` path (#1), `b.houseRules` (#2), and Live Sheet's PACTAP AP-grant
  codec (`_apEnc`/`_apDec`, which shares `_apHash`/`_AK`). Legacy `cat:'campaign'` events replay inert (the
  engine's `_replay` tolerates a missing mutator). Verified in real Chromium (`random-manual-e2e.mjs` 2/2:
  CharGen pickers + advancement + DM Console import). Why in `DECISIONS.md`

  across the tools + `js/` + tests: 13 are referenced; **`SIG_ALG`** is a confirmed zero-reference export
  (used only inside `engine.js` by `signPayload`/`verifyPayload`). Filed as a follow-up roadmap item

  (`tools/DM-Console.html`; `js/engine.js` untouched, no `DATA.version` bump, no schema/RLS change).
  A "Copy rules from…" picker on the Campaign Rules panel lists the DM's other campaigns (owner/co-DM);
  picking one loads its rules JSON into the current form via the existing `loadRulesIntoPanel()` — a
  starting-point copy, not a live link. Nothing persists until the DM clicks the existing **Save rules**
  button, which writes only the current campaign through the existing `setCampaignRules()` (DM-only, RLS).
  The source campaign is never mutated (the loader clones `houseRules` into a fresh object and only reads
  grid values — verified in a real Chromium DOM, 13/13, incl. the source-unchanged property). Picker hides
  when the DM has no other campaigns; option labels use `textContent` (no innerHTML), so no `esc()` needed.
- **2026-07-13 · perf — Live Sheet: stop re-folding+re-computing for "AP available" in hot paths**
  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; `js/engine.js` untouched, no `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0).
  The campaign-AP-model work had routed `buy()` and the paid spell-swap eligibility check through
  `apAvailable(null)`, which internally runs a fresh `foldBuild(null)+compute()` — redundant next to the
  fold each caller already had. (a) `buy()` now folds the LOG **once** (`b0`) and threads it into
  `priceOf()`/`legalCheck()` (both gained an optional pre-folded-build param) and reuses it for the dup
  guard, availability, and `b0.hd`, dropping ~4 redundant folds + 1 redundant `compute()` per purchase.
  (b) `openNames()` hoisted its per-known-spell-slot `apAvailable(null)` out of the discipline loop into
  one reuse of its existing `b` fold — was O(spell-slots) full recomputes, now O(1). The AP figure is
  byte-identical (`apAvailable(null) === _apRemaining(compute(foldBuild(null),_dmOpts()).spendable,
  economy(null).spent)`); `buyoffDrawback()`/`_swapTally()` left as-is (already one minimal call each).
- **2026-07-12 · fix — four aggregate-review findings across both tools**
  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; `js/engine.js` untouched, no
  `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0). A pre-promotion `/code-review high` over the whole `main…preview`
  diff surfaced these; all four verified fixed in a real browser (13/13 checks):
  - **(pre-existing, likely already live) Live Sheet "☁ Save to cloud" saved an empty record.** It read
    `window.RULES`/`window.LOG`/`window.SEQ`, which are always `undefined` (top-level `let` bindings are
    never mirrored onto `window` — the same bug class already fixed in the adjacent Load handler). The
    persisted `stats` collapsed to `{name}` with no event log, so any later load failed with "No character
    data found." Now routes through `buildCharacterEnvelope({name,rules:RULES,LOG,SEQ,id})` (bare
    identifiers) — the identical shape `save()`/`exportJSON()` already use, so it can't regress this way again.
  - **CharGen 🎲 Randomize ignored DM AP.** Its spend cap used the raw player budget and `compute()` with no
    opts, so a loaded campaign character with DM AP was under-built and its affordability gate tripped a
    spurious OVER BUDGET past the player budget. Now caps at `compute(b,_cgDmOpts()).spendable` and measures
    OVER BUDGET with the same opts — a no-op for local builds (verified: `{dmAp:0}` opts match no-opts across
    all 20 fixtures), correct fill-to-spendable for campaign characters.
  - **Live Sheet grandfather notice read as a hard "⚠ Needs review".** The non-blocking `ignore_player_ap`
    notice was pushed into `validate()`'s issues[] unconditionally; the tray had no advisory tier, so a
    benign, expected state alarmed the player — while CharGen showed the identical notice as a calm ⓘ. Added
    `_lsIsAdvisory()` (mirrors CharGen's `isAdvisory()` verbatim) and split the tray: advisory notes render as
    ⓘ and don't inflate the "Needs review (N)" count.
  - **CharGen cloud-load label included the date.** The load confirm/flash read the button's full
    `textContent` ("Aria — 2026-07-10"); now carries a `data-cname` with the clean name.

- **2026-07-12 · refactor(live-sheet) — collapse the `_dmApStatus`/`_rulesStatus` hand-mirror into one
  variable** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0).
  Code-review follow-up from `feat/campaign-ap-model`: `window._dmApStatus` was a second, hand-mirrored
  copy of the pre-existing `_rulesStatus` var (set to the same value at the same two call sites — the
  cloud-load handler and `refreshCloudCampaignRules()`), risking a future edit updating one and forgetting
  the other. Promoted `_rulesStatus` to `window._rulesStatus` (it needed cross-closure access anyway —
  `apCeiling()`/`_dmOpts()` live outside the `sync-ready` listener's closure that originally declared it
  `var`-local) and deleted `window._dmApStatus` entirely; the AP-source chip and the campaign-rules badge
  now read the identical variable, so they cannot desync. Verified in a real browser: the four-state AP
  display, the "from DM"/"unavailable" chips, and the campaign-rules badge all still render correctly
  post-collapse (9/9 checks).

- **2026-07-12 · chore(testing) — AUD-1 follow-up: audit.py now catches BUILD mirror drift**
  (`testing/scripts/audit.py`; no app code touched, parity 20/0). New `check_build_version_sync()`:
  compares `js/engine.js`'s `BUILD` (the documented single source of truth, `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md`)
  against its four hand-maintained mirrors — CharGen's line-1 comment/`<title>`/header `.sub` label,
  Live Sheet's line-1 comment, DM Console's `TOOL_VERSION` — and fails loudly on any mismatch.
  `index.html` stays excluded (reads `BUILD` live, can never drift); `DATA.version` needs no
  CharGen-mirror check since CharGen imports `DATA` live from `js/engine.js` as of D-GH26. Verified
  both directions: 6/6 pass on the current (in-sync) tree, and a deliberately mismatched
  `TOOL_VERSION` correctly fails with exit 1 (then restored — confirmed clean diff).

- **2026-07-12 · chore(testing) — REV-11: headless engine-parity gate now runs in CI**
  (`testing/scripts/engine-parity-ci.mjs`, `.github/workflows/engine-parity.yml`,
  `testing/README.md`/`docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md` updated; no runtime app code touched, parity 20/0 — this
  script *is* the parity check). A faithful Node port of `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`'s assert
  mode: same 20 fixtures (build/live-sheet/event-sourcing ids now *discovered* from the fixture
  directories rather than hardcoded, so a new fixture is picked up automatically), same
  `expected-results.csv`, same per-fixture assertions incl. the CG-003/CG-007 special-cases. Wired as a
  new, separate GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/engine-parity.yml`) — deliberately not folded into the
  existing `character-gen-e2e.yml` randomized Playwright harness, since this one needs no browser install
  and finishes in seconds, so it can gate a wider path set (`testing/**`, not just tool/engine-touching
  PRs) without slowing every PR down. Verified both directions: passes clean on the real fixtures, and
  correctly fails (exit 1) when an expected value is deliberately corrupted.

- **2026-07-12 · docs — batch: REV-12 esc() hard invariant, rules-correctness review note, AI working
  defaults, pre-release audit trigger, stale parity-count fix; graduate REV-10 as already-resolved**
  (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`, `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`; no code change). Five small roadmap items
  bundled into one docs-only PR: (1) `AGENTS.md` Hard rules now states the `esc()`-everywhere invariant
  explicitly (REV-12); (2) also fixed a stale "9 passed / 0 failed" parity count sitting right next to it
  (every other reference already said 20); (3) `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md` documents the rules-correctness
  `/code-review` prompt pattern for engine PRs; (4) an "AI working defaults" note (model/effort defaults,
  one-task-per-session, don't read large files wholesale — A8); (5) a pre-release full-audit trigger note
  with a sample multi-lens workflow shape (A10). **REV-10 graduated without a code change** — its premise
  (`.claude/` fully untracked) is outdated: `.gitignore` already scopes to just the ephemeral state
  (`*.json`, `.fpp-reminder-state`, `worktrees/`), while `.claude/commands/*.md`/`.claude/agents/*.md` are
  intentionally tracked project content (the skills this repo's agents use, e.g. `add-roadmap-task`) —
  running the old `git rm --cached -r .claude` instruction literally would have deleted them from version
  control, a regression, not a fix.

- **2026-07-12 · feat(ap-model) — CharGen and the Live Sheet now show one identical spendable-AP total,
  honoring DM AP + `ignore_player_ap`** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`;
  `js/engine.js` untouched, no `DATA.version` bump, parity 20/0). Closes `feat/campaign-ap-model`. Live
  Sheet stopped pre-mixing DM AP into `b.budget` (it was also never actually spendable before — `buy()`
  gated against the raw player-only ledger even though the display showed DM AP); CharGen got its first
  cloud character-load/save feature, since it had no cloud character concept at all to hang DM AP off of;
  both tools now show a capped "AP left", a non-blocking grandfather notice on an `ignore_player_ap`
  toggle-flip, and a fourth "DM AP unavailable" display state. A `/code-review` pass found and fixed a
  pre-existing, unrelated Live Sheet bug in the same code path (`window.LOG=` writes that silently never
  updated the real `LOG`, so "Load character" swapped the AP display but not the actual character). Full
  narrative in `docs/sessions/2026-07-12-campaign-ap-model-implementation.md`; option analysis in
  `DECISIONS.md` `D-GH-2026-07-12-campaign-ap-model`.

- **2026-07-12 · docs(engine) — document compute()'s two-pool AP model + anti-double-count invariant**
  (`js/engine.js`; comment-only, no logic change, parity unchanged). First foundation slice of the campaign
  AP model (`docs/plans/2026-07-12-campaign-ap-model-cold-review.md`): documents at the composition point
  that spendable = Player AP (`b.budget`, folded from award events) + DM AP (`opts.dmAp`, server-only), that
  `ignorePlayerAp` drops the player pool without refunding it, that the returned `budget` is a legacy alias
  of `spendable`, and the anti-double-count invariant (never write derived spendable/dmAp back into the
  log/budget/exports).

- **2026-07-12 · docs(agents) — add "Fix depth" communication convention**
  (`AGENTS.md`). New rule under Communication conventions: when a problem has both a shallow fix and a
  deeper root-cause fix, surface **both** as options (tiered A/B format) with a recommendation — default to
  the deeper fix unless it's risky/wide/soon-obsolete — instead of silently proposing only the cheap one.

- **2026-07-12 · refactor(rules) — one kind token per ban call site; `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` accepts `draws` as a `drawbacks` alias**
  (`js/engine.js`, `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; `DATA.version`
  unchanged, parity 20/0). Code-review follow-up: the two ban-checkers used different kind vocabularies for
  the same category — `campBarred('draws', …)` (the legacy PACTRULES/`HOUSE.disabled` vocabulary) next to
  `cloudRuleBarred('drawbacks', …)` — so a future copy-paste of `'draws'` into `cloudRuleBarred` would have
  silently failed open (no `'draws'` key → `false`, bans stop hiding). Rather than migrate the persisted
  `'draws'` storage key (thrown away by the pending retire-PACTRULES work anyway), `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` now maps
  **both** `drawbacks` (canonical) and `draws` (documented alias) to `bannedDrawbacks`, and the two picker
  call sites use `'draws'` to match their adjacent `campBarred('draws', …)`. Either token now resolves in
  either checker — the fail-silent trap is structurally gone.

- **2026-07-12 · feat(rules) — banned drawbacks/arts are now hidden from the pickers (+ de-diverge Live Sheet's `cloudRuleBarred`)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`;
  `D-GH-2026-07-12-campaign-rules-snapshot`; `DATA.version` unchanged, parity still 20/0). Closes the
  enforcement-only gap from the previous entry: a cloud-campaign character's drawback and art pickers now
  live-filter out DM-banned entries (already-selected ones grandfathered), matching how boons/species/
  masteries already behave. Live Sheet's `cloudRuleBarred()` no longer hardcodes `{masteries, boons}` — it
  now derives its kind→field map from the shared engine export `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` (imported + exposed on
  `window`), so it stays in lockstep with `validate()` and covers every ban kind at once. UI wiring only; no
  engine/`compute()` change.

- **2026-07-12 · feat(rules) — campaign rules can now ban drawbacks and arts**
  (`js/engine.js`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; `D-GH-2026-07-12-campaign-rules-snapshot`; `DATA.version`
  unchanged — `validate()` is display-only and never read by `compute()`, parity still 20/0). Extends the
  cloud campaign rules format with `bannedDrawbacks` + `bannedArts`, mirroring the existing five ban fields:
  `validate()` gains the two checks (surfaced as violations wherever it's already consumed — CharGen and Live
  Sheet on join/save), `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` gains the two kinds, and the DM Console rules editor gains two grids.
  This is the enforcement MVP of the retire-PACTRULES-code plan
  (`docs/plans/2026-07-12-campaign-rules-snapshot.md`). Live-picker *hiding* of banned drawbacks/arts is a
  deliberate, purely-additive fast-follow (see DECISIONS) — not shipped here.

- **2026-07-11 · chore(testing) — add `playwright` + `supabase` CLI as devDependencies**
  (`testing/package.json`, `testing/package-lock.json`; dev-tooling only, no app code touched,
  `DATA.version` unchanged). Both were installed and verified working during the save-integrity session
  (Playwright launches Chromium; `npx supabase --version` resolves) but never landed in the repo, so a
  fresh checkout/CI would have had to rediscover and reinstall them. `npm run e2e:character` and local
  Supabase CLI usage (`npx supabase ...`) now resolve immediately after `cd testing && npm install`.

- **2026-07-11 · fix(sql) — database-level backstop: `characters.ap` can no longer be set on insert**
  (`sql/rls-policies.sql`, `sql/migrations/2026-07-11-lock-down-character-insert-ap.sql`; applied to the
  live project). Closes the "NOT YET DONE" follow-up from
  D-GH-2026-07-11-clone-campaign-character-standalone: until now, a new character's `ap` resetting to `0`
  was enforced only by the client choosing not to include the field on insert — nothing in the database
  would have stopped a future insert from setting a nonzero value. `characters` INSERT is now
  column-restricted to `(id, owner_id, name, kind, stats)` for `authenticated` (mirroring the existing
  UPDATE-path lockdown), and the `characters_insert` policy's `WITH CHECK` now also requires `ap = 0`,
  independently. Verified against the live project directly (not just the repo files) before and after;
  Supabase advisor scan and recent logs checked post-apply — no new issues. Doesn't affect
  `join_campaign()` (`SECURITY DEFINER`, bypasses this policy) or the app's only client-side character
  insert (`js/sync.js`'s `pushCharacter`, which already sends exactly this column list).
- **2026-07-11 · feat(livesheet) — clone a campaign character to a standalone character**
  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `js/sync.js`, `js/dm.js` import; D-GH-2026-07-11-clone-campaign-
  character-standalone). Campaign-linked characters get a "⧉ Clone to standalone" action that copies the
  raw build data (stats/event log) into a brand-new character record owned by the player, not tied to any
  campaign. `campaign_id` is omitted from the insert so the server defaults it to `NULL`; the verified,
  DM-Console-only `characters.ap` running total also resets to `0` on the new row (no DM is left to vouch
  for it), but any AP that DM actually awarded isn't lost — the clone fetches the source character's full
  `ap_awards` history and appends one itemized log entry per award (real date, amount, DM, note),
  oldest-first, after the existing history. The original campaign character is left untouched: the
  source read uses a new pure-read `peekCharacter()` (`js/sync.js`) instead of `loadCharacter()`, since
  the latter's `reconcile()` can silently push this device's pending local edits to the server as a side
  effect — which would have contradicted the "original untouched" guarantee. Also guards against
  duplicate clones (an in-flight lock survives the Cloud menu being closed/reopened mid-clone) and shows
  an accurate "saved locally, will sync when online" flash instead of a false success message when
  offline. Display-only; `DATA.version` unchanged. See `DECISIONS.md` for the append-vs-splice reasoning
  (the migrated awards are never inserted into the log's historical positions, to avoid retroactively
  repricing an already-frozen purchase — the same class of risk documented in D-GH34/36/37). Also: the
  clone list's row markup is now a shared `buildCharRow()` helper (computes each character's escaped name
  once instead of twice), a successful clone updates the local character list in place instead of
  re-fetching the whole list from the server, and the clone no longer JSON-round-trips `stats` purely for
  a defensive copy it didn't need (the source read is already a fresh, unaliased object). A retry after a
  failed clone now reuses the same pending clone id instead of minting a fresh one each click — the first
  failed attempt already wrote a dirty local record before the network push failed, so retrying with a new
  id would have left that one behind as an invisible orphan that later syncs up as a duplicate character;
  the id is cleared once a clone actually succeeds.
- **2026-07-11 · docs(chargen) — fix stale/misleading comment on `PATCH_SLOTS.IDENTITY`**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; comment-only, no logic touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). A
  dead-code audit flagged the field as a removal candidate because its own comment said "otherwise
  unused" — it's actually live and fully wired (`PATCH_FIELD_SLOT` → `_cgSlotPatch`'s IDENTITY case);
  the comment used "unused" to mean "unused **by the cold-reviewed plan's taxonomy**," which read as
  dead-code language out of context. Reworded to state plainly that both `IDENTITY` and `size` are live.
- **2026-07-11 · docs(process) — retire sequential D-GH numbers for D-GH-\<date\>-\<slug\>**
  (D-GH-2026-07-11-dgh-numbering-scheme). The old scheme collided at least eight times across this
  project's history; the new form is collision-proof by construction (piggybacks on the already-enforced
  one-task-per-branch rule), so no live-remote check or renumbering is needed going forward. Existing
  `D-GH1`–`D-GH49` entries are untouched. Updated `AGENTS.md` and the `/add-roadmap-task`/`/pick-task`
  skills to match. Docs-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.
- **2026-07-11 · feat(engine) — externalize the AP-by-level ladder to `js/ap-by-level.js` (D-GH49)**
  New editable module exports `AP_BY_LEVEL` (the level→AP budget table) and `DEFAULT_LEVEL`; `js/engine.js`
  imports them and surfaces `DATA.apByLevel`/`DATA.defaultAp`, keeping `DATA.levelAP`/`DATA.level1AP` as
  back-compat aliases (`compute()`'s racial-trait lock reads `DATA.level1AP`). All three tools pick it up
  through the existing DATA bridge — no tool change. Values are byte-identical to the old inline literal,
  so `compute()` output is unchanged; `DATA.version` NOT bumped and `testing/expected/` unchanged; parity
  stays **20/0**.
- **2026-07-11 · chore(engine) — remove unused `DATA.benchLevels` and `DATA.armourStandalone`**
  Both were provably dead (a repo-wide dead-code audit found zero reads outside their own definitions):
  `benchLevels` was a redundant inverse copy of `DATA.levelAP`, `armourStandalone` an orphaned twin of
  the live `DATA.armourClimb`. Deleted from the `js/engine.js` DATA literal; display-agnostic values
  never read by `compute()`, so `DATA.version` unchanged. Parity stays **20/0**.

- **2026-07-11 · docs(sessions) — add session note for the AUD-1 health-check task (D-GH47)**
  (`docs/sessions/2026-07-11-aud1-health-check.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged).
  Records three roadmap-spec reinterpretations, a `/code-review high` pass that found and fixed six real
  bugs in the new `testing/scripts/audit.py`, a same-day D-GH46 numbering collision with a concurrent
  session's PR #160 (renumbered to D-GH47), and a rebase that reported "no conflicts" while silently
  leaving a duplicate/orphaned `DECISIONS.md` title line — caught only by reading the merged content
  directly rather than trusting the rebase's own success message.
- **2026-07-11 · feat — Feature B: save-file integrity (tamper-evidence)** (D-GH48; `js/engine.js`,
  `js/character-store.js`, all three `tools/*.html`; `DATA.version` unchanged — additive, no `compute()`
  change; parity **20/0**). Engine gains synchronous `signPayload`/`verifyPayload` + a self-contained
  SHA-256 (validated against the NIST vectors) and an order-independent canonical serializer.
  `js/character-store.js` owns the file-format policy: `buildCharacterEnvelope()` signs **by default**
  (`sig:{alg,hash}`) so any exported file is signed by construction, while the localStorage autosave/local
  save opt out with `{sign:false}` (that copy is never signature-checked on the way back in). The read side
  is a single shared `verifyCharacterEnvelope()` returning `{status, tampered, envelope}`, called by every
  file-load path — Live Sheet import and CharGen load flash a **non-blocking** warning; DM Console badges the
  roster card ("⚠ edited") and adds a Flags-&-notes line (a file that is both tampered *and* a different
  rules version now shows both notices). `sig` is metadata the engine never reads, so signed files
  price/rebuild identically and older/unsigned files still load. Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof — the
  offline stopgap before the Supabase server-side enforcement phase; the cloud load path is intentionally
  out of scope (server-authoritative under RLS). Graduated from `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`.

- **2026-07-11 · docs(sessions) — add session note for the communication-conventions fix (D-GH46)**
  (`docs/sessions/2026-07-11-communication-conventions.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version`
  unchanged). Records the diagnosis (a live `AskUserQuestion` failure, `close-session.md`'s flat list
  working exactly as written, and no durable home for a stated preference) and the judgment calls made
  along the way (where the preference persists, the retry-must-be-genuine correction, the
  recommend-by-default bar) — the plan changing mid-session to fix the tooling itself, plus several
  reasonably-second-guessable decisions, both trigger a session note per this repo's own convention.

- **2026-07-11 · docs(process) — communication conventions: recommend-with-reasoning + `AskUserQuestion`
  reliability** (D-GH46; `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/commands/pick-task.md`, `.claude/commands/close-session.md`;
  no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). Three related conventions, all motivated by real
  incidents from this same session: (1) a tiered `A`/`A1`/`A2` format for presenting options, with every
  option — not just the recommended one — carrying a one-line reason; (2) a rule that a failed
  `AskUserQuestion` tool call is not an answer and must never be silently treated as one (retry once, wait
  for a genuine reply, only surface failure on a second miss); (3) `/close-session`'s action list now tags
  every item Recommended/Not-recommended with a reason, defaulting to Recommended for anything that's
  already cleared its own gate (tests passed, review done) rather than deferring routine cleanup "to be
  safe."
- **2026-07-11 · fix(testing) — AUD-1 audit.py: `/code-review high` fix-up, still on the same PR** (`testing/
  scripts/audit.py`; no app code or `DATA.version` touched; parity unaffected at 20/0). Six findings from a
  post-hoc `/code-review high` on the AUD-1 PR, all fixed before merge: (1) the engine-symbol drift-guard
  regex required an object-literal RHS (`= {`), missing a re-pasted `const compute = (b) => {...}` or
  `const MUT = function(){}` — now derived from a `GUARDED_SYMBOLS` tuple matched on the declaration alone,
  regardless of RHS shape; (2) the RLS proof's `_rls_rejected` inferred a blocked write from "body is
  non-empty", which could false-positive a SECURITY failure if a trigger echoed the row back UNCHANGED —
  replaced with `_write_took_effect`, which parses the echoed row and checks the actual forbidden value
  landed; (3) the `skipWaiting()` guard only scanned the install-handler region, missing a module-level
  `self.skipWaiting();` outside any handler (worse — no gating at all) — added `_has_top_level_skipwaiting`,
  a brace-depth scan for exactly that; (4) the engine-import scan used `.search()`, so a tool's import split
  across two `import { ... } from '../js/engine.js'` statements only had the first one's symbols seen —
  switched to `.findall()` + union; (5) the `ENGINE_SYMBOLS` constant was dead (never referenced) — split
  into `REQUIRED_IMPORTS`/`GUARDED_SYMBOLS` and wired into both checks it names, which also mechanically
  fixed (1); (6) `check_manifest` double-reported a missing `start_url`/`scope` as both "missing required
  field" and a separate value-mismatch FAIL — now skips the mismatch check for a field already known
  missing. Verified: clean tree still 20/0/exit 0; all prior planted breaks still fail loudly; new planted
  breaks for each fix (arrow-function re-def, unchanged-row echo, top-level `skipWaiting`, split import)
  each individually confirmed to fail loudly where they previously would have passed silently.

- **2026-07-11 · feat(testing) — AUD-1: static health-check script `testing/scripts/audit.py`** (new file;
  Python **stdlib only**, no installs; no app code or `DATA.version` touched; parity unaffected at 20/0).
  Runs in seconds and exits non-zero on any hard failure, so it drops into a pre-commit hook or CI. Checks:
  every service-worker `PRE_CACHE` URL resolves to a file on disk; PWA icons 192/512/180 exist *and* are
  the right pixel dimensions (PNG IHDR parsed via `struct`); `404.html` present; `manifest.json` has the
  required fields with `scope`/`start_url` = `/PACT/` and a maskable icon; every app HTML page registers the
  SW (404 + Players-Guide exempt); the SW install handler has no unconditional `skipWaiting()`; and an
  **engine-symbol drift guard** — each tool imports `DATA`/`compute`/`MUT` from `js/engine.js` and locally
  re-defines none of `DATA`/`compute`/`baseBuild`/`MUT`. Media assets >100 KB are reported as warnings
  (non-fatal). Optional `--rls` mode (stdlib `urllib`, credentials from env, never committed) proves the
  Supabase REST API rejects a player writing `characters.ap` and setting `campaign_id` to an unjoined
  campaign. Two roadmap-spec items were reinterpreted against the current architecture — see D-GH47
  (renumbered from a same-day collision with PR #160's D-GH46 — see that entry's addendum).
  Verified: clean tree 20/0 exit 0; planted breaks (missing `PRE_CACHE` file, reintroduced local `MUT`)
  fail loudly exit 1; RLS decision logic unit-tested.

- **2026-07-11 · docs(sessions) — bring the "simple batch" session note up to date** (`docs/sessions/
  2026-07-11-pick-task-simple-batch.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). The note had gone
  stale after its first write — PR #153 (stale-roadmap closure + a `D-GH44`/`D-GH45` collision with a
  concurrent session's PR #151), a retroactive `/code-review` on it, PR #156's follow-up fixes, and a
  merge-without-explicit-approval incident on PR #152 had all happened since. Rewritten to cover the whole
  session; adds a second `ai-lessons-learned` candidate lesson (merging shared state needs its own
  explicit trigger, not an inferred one from a broader closing instruction).

- **2026-07-11 · docs — D-GH45 follow-up: durable ai-lessons-learned citation + verify its second stale
  claim** (`DECISIONS.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). Two findings from a `/code-review`
  pass on the merged D-GH45 PR: (1) its citation of `ai-lessons-learned`'s inbox file was a bare filename
  with no path/commit pin, and that repo's curation workflow deletes inbox files once folded into
  `topics/` — now cited with a repo path and commit SHA. (2) the removed roadmap entry's second "Done
  when" clause (an e2e-harness workaround) was never actually checked, only the JS-bug clause was —
  checked now: no such workaround exists on `preview`, matching the same "references an unrelated unmerged
  branch" pattern already seen on the Level-up cap fix's own stale clause (PR #152).

- **2026-07-11 · fix(chargen) — stop the cloud-campaign UI refetching/re-rendering on every hourly token
  refresh** (D-GH44 follow-up; `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no `js/engine.js`/rules change,
  `DATA.version` unchanged). Found by a focused post-merge `/code-review` pass on PR #151's fix/cleanup
  commits: `updateAuth(session)` ran unconditionally on every Supabase auth event — including the
  `autoRefreshToken`-driven `TOKEN_REFRESHED` event that fires roughly hourly for any signed-in session —
  so once an hour the campaign `<select>` and every species/origin-class/mastery/boon picker got wiped and
  rebuilt via `innerHTML`, a disruptive unprompted re-render that could hit a player mid-interaction. Pre-
  existing since the original feature landed (the earlier `onAuthChange(event,session)` param-order fix
  didn't change how often the callback fired, only what value it received). Fixed by gating the
  refetch/rebuild on the signed-in boolean actually transitioning (`wasSignedIn` vs `nowSignedIn`) instead
  of firing on every event — this also collapses a pre-existing redundant double-fetch on page load
  (`onAuthChange`'s initial event and the separate `currentSession()` call both used to trigger a fetch).
  Verified via headless Chromium: 1 `listMyCampaigns()` call on boot (was 2), 0 extra calls or picker
  rebuilds on a simulated `TOKEN_REFRESHED`, a real sign-out/sign-in still correctly refetches and resets.
  `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` — 20/0.

- **2026-07-11 · docs(roadmap) — close the CharGen feature-autocomplete scroll-position task as stale, no
  code change** (D-GH45; `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version`
  unchanged). The `fix/chargen-feature-autocomplete-scroll-position` TODO described `_featAC`'s `place()`
  double-counting `window.scrollY` on a `position:fixed` menu — that pattern doesn't exist in
  `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`'s current code (`top` is computed purely from
  `getBoundingClientRect()`) and, per `git log -S"scrollY"`, never has. Two independent sessions
  (2026-07-10's `ai-lessons-learned` inbox note, and this session picking the same roadmap item up fresh
  on 2026-07-11) reached the same "doesn't reproduce" conclusion without either one removing the stale
  entry, so it kept resurfacing for a third investigation. Removed with no code fix, since there's nothing
  to fix.

- **2026-07-11 · fix(live-sheet) — "Level up" buy-tile stays free and clickable past Hit Die 20**
  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; UI-only, `DATA.version` unchanged — `DATA.levelAP` already stops at
  20). The buy-panel's "Level up → Hit Die N" tile priced past HD 20 via a generic `compute()` diff that
  silently fell through to 0 AP once `DATA.levelAP` ran out of entries, letting a character level up for
  free with no bound — `levelDelta()` already returned 0 at the cap (used elsewhere to detect "at cap"),
  but the tile itself wasn't gated on it, even though the buy-panel builder already computed that same
  `levelDelta()` value (`nd`) and just never applied it. Fix: pass `nd<=0` as the tile's block reason, the
  same `reasonExtra` mechanism every other at-cap tile already uses — no new gating primitive needed.

- **2026-07-11 · docs — add a pre-release manual QA checklist** (`docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`, `AGENTS.md`; no
  app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). Documents the cross-tool click-through the automated
  `engine-parity` gate can't cover: CharGen → export to Live Sheet → buy-off/ledger check → push to cloud
  → DM Console award-AP → console-error check at each step. `AGENTS.md`'s per-change checklist now points
  to it, scoped to release-shaped PRs.
- **2026-07-11 · feat(chargen) — CharGen campaign-rules awareness (sign-in + live filter)** (D-GH44;
  `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; `DATA.version` unchanged — no rules/`compute()` logic touched).
  CharGen's module bridge now also imports `validate()` from `js/engine.js`, plus `currentSession`/
  `onAuthChange` (`js/auth.js`) and `listMyCampaigns`/`getCampaign` (`js/campaign.js`) in a **separate**
  `<script type="module">` from the engine bridge — auth/campaign transitively load `@supabase/supabase-js`
  from a CDN, and keeping that import graph independent means a dead network only drops the new cloud UI,
  never the offline character builder (verified: a network-import failure no longer blocks `engine-ready`).
  A new header widget lets a signed-in player pick from their cloud campaigns; its DM-set rules then filter
  banned species/origin species/origin classes/masteries/boons out of CharGen's pickers live (mirrors Live
  Sheet's D-GH16 live-filter: remove unowned-and-banned choices, never hide something already picked), and
  any remaining violation (incl. multi-discipline count, which the picker filters don't attempt — that
  logic lives only in `validate()`) surfaces as a `☁` warning via the existing warnings list. Local
  `PACTRULES:` house rules (`CG_CAMPAIGN`/`campBarred`) are untouched — separate, offline mechanism.
  `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` — 20/0 (engine untouched; also spot-checked via headless Chromium
  that a network-blocked CDN still boots CharGen fully offline, and that a mocked signed-in campaign with
  banned items correctly filters the species/origin-class/mastery pickers).
  **Pre-merge `/code-review` pass (same PR) found and fixed 3 real bugs:** (1) the `onAuthChange`
  callback destructured a single `session` param, but `js/auth.js` calls `cb(event, session)` — every
  auth event (including sign-out) is a truthy string, so `_cloudSignedIn` got stuck `true` after the
  first event ever fired; (2) `applyBuild()` rebuilt the species/origin-class/mastery/boon pickers
  *before* `LOG` reflected the character being loaded (that rebuild happens later, via
  `replaceWholeLogFromBuild(_domReadBuild())`), so loading a character that owned a now-campaign-banned
  choice silently stripped it from the loaded build with no warning — fixed by threading the build
  actually being loaded into `buildSpeciesSelects`/`buildOriginClassSelects`/`buildMasteryGrid`/
  `buildBoonGrid` as an optional override instead of relying on stale `readBuild()`; (3) the
  second-origin-species picker only checked `bannedOriginSpecies`, missing the generic `bannedSpecies`
  ban `validate()` also applies to `species2`. Also fixed in the same pass: the cloud campaign `<option>`
  id/name are now escaped via the file's existing `_csEsc()` helper (a locally-duplicated, weaker `esc()`
  is gone), and a stale in-flight `listMyCampaigns()` fetch from a prior sign-in can no longer resolve
  after a subsequent sign-out and repopulate campaign state. Re-verified: 20/0 parity, offline boot intact,
  and headless-browser checks that a banned-but-owned species/origin-class/mastery now survives a character
  load unmodified while still being correctly filtered out of pickers for builds that don't already own it.
  **Follow-up cleanup pass (same PR, remaining review findings):** `js/engine.js` gains a new
  `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` export (display-only, next to `validate()` — never bumps `DATA.version`) so the
  kind→rules-field mapping lives in one place instead of being hardcoded separately per tool; CharGen's
  `cloudRuleBarred()` now sources it from there (Live Sheet's own copy is untouched — out of scope for
  this PR). `buildSpeciesSelects`/`buildOriginClassSelects`/`buildMasteryGrid` now share a
  `cloudAllowedList()` filter helper instead of repeating the same filter-unless-already-selected shape
  three times. `window._cloudCampaignRules` (redundant, fully derivable from `window._cloudCampaign.rules`)
  is gone, replaced by a `cloudRules()` accessor. `refreshCloudFilters()` and the boot-time picker
  population now compute `readBuild()` once and share it instead of each of the 4-5 picker-rebuild
  functions independently re-folding the event log. Re-verified: 20/0 parity, offline boot intact, and the
  same filter/load/sign-out behavioral checks as above all still pass unchanged.

- **2026-07-10 · fix(sql) — lock down remaining Supabase function EXECUTE grants (anon)** (D-GH15
  addendum; `sql/migrations/2026-07-10-lock-down-remaining-function-grants.sql`, `sql/rls-policies.sql`;
  no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). Revoked the default Postgres EXECUTE-to-`PUBLIC` grant
  on the ~13 functions the security advisor still flagged, matching the earlier `award_ap` fix: the 3
  trigger-only functions lose EXECUTE entirely (fine — Postgres blocks direct calls to `returns trigger`
  functions regardless of grant); the 6 client-facing RPCs and 5 internal RLS-helper functions keep
  `authenticated` access, just lose the redundant `PUBLIC` grant. Verified live via
  `has_function_privilege`: all ~13 now show `anon_can_execute=false`; `get_advisors` shows no new
  findings post-migration. Pure hygiene/defense-in-depth — none of these were actually exploitable
  (every one gates on `auth.uid()`, which is `NULL` for `anon`).

- **2026-07-10 · docs — cross-check DECISIONS.md/CHANGELOG.md/roadmap and fix what they disagreed on**
  (`AGENTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`,
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-08-dgh-numbering-collision-fix.md`,
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-docs-consistency-audit.md`; no code/rules change). One-time consistency pass.
  Found and fixed a previously-undetected **triple** `D-GH30` collision (three separate 2026-07-08
  decisions all claimed the same number, one of them within ~8 minutes of another) — renumbered the two
  later ones to `D-GH42`/`D-GH43` per the project's own documented renumber-on-merge fallback, with
  addendum notes and every cross-reference updated. Also fixed `AGENTS.md`'s "Active Priorities" section
  (still named the already-graduated engine-bridge migration as current focus, and still described
  `DATA`/`compute`/`MUT` as unbridged) and a stale `9/0`/`5/0` engine-parity pass count in `AGENTS.md`/the
  roadmap (11 places) that should have read the live `20/0` (`testing/expected/expected-results.csv`'s
  current row count; `testing/README.md` already had it right). Full findings — including one
  possibly-overstated CI-coverage CHANGELOG tag flagged but deliberately left for a human call, and a
  spot-check confirming no other roadmap items are secretly already-done — in
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-docs-consistency-audit.md`.
- **2026-07-10 · docs — fix the same stale `9 passed / 0 failed` parity count in `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`**
  (`docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`; no code/rules change). Found during this branch's own parity verification, just
  outside the docs-consistency audit's declared `DECISIONS.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/roadmap scope, but the same
  class of staleness already fixed there — both spots now correctly say **20**. The same section's
  fixture list (only enumerates 9 of the current 20 fixtures) and `expected-results.csv` column list
  (missing `new_engine_events_applied`) are also stale but left as a noted follow-up rather than fixed
  here — see `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-docs-consistency-audit.md` finding 4b.
- **2026-07-10 · docs(roadmap) — remove stale duplicate "Add Supabase advisor/log check" entry**
  (`docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`; no code change). The step it asked for was already added to `AGENTS.md`'s
  per-change checklist and graduated to `CHANGELOG.md` on 2026-07-09 (commit `e770e26`) — this was a
  leftover duplicate that never got pruned from the roadmap. No further action needed.
- **2026-07-10 · fix(live-sheet) — reintroduce D-GH5's mobile app-shell so header/overlay buttons stop
  sticking on scroll** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, `DATA.version` unchanged). D-GH5's
  static-header app-shell (body → non-scrolling flex column, `.layout` as the only scroll region) had never
  actually landed in this file — `.top` was unconditionally `position:sticky` at all viewport widths, so
  Export/Import/Cloud/Sheet-toggle/Campaign kept fighting the same mobile-Chrome repaint bug D-GH5 already
  diagnosed. Added a `@media(max-width:768px)` block (placed after every base rule it overrides, so cascade
  order doesn't silently re-enable `position:sticky`) implementing the app-shell for `.top`/`.eco`/`.bar`/
  `.layout`, plus a simpler fix for the printable-sheet overlay's `.shtop` (AI Portrait/Print/Close) —
  `position:static` there, so it scrolls away with the overlay's own content instead of staying pinned
  (`#sheetview` is its own scroll container, not the window, so it doesn't need the full app-shell
  treatment). Verified headless at 390×700 (mobile) and 1280×800 (desktop, unaffected) via Playwright:
  header now stays put through a 400px `.layout` scroll and `.shtop` correctly scrolls off after a 300px
  overlay scroll. Left `#lmobar` (bottom AP/Undo/Redo bar), `#buysearch` (pinned buy-list search), and
  `#apFloat` (floating AP badge) as intentionally fixed/sticky — none are in scope per the task's own
  "Save/Load/Share/Sheet/AI Portrait/Campaign" list. DM Console's `header.topbar` has the same unconditional
  `position:sticky` but no existing app-shell scaffold to extend into — left out of scope as a possible
  follow-up; CharGen already implements this exact pattern (`.stickyhead` + `.mobile-action-bar`, comment
  "M8"), so no change needed there; index.html has no equivalent header, just transient status
  banners (offline badge, SW-update bar), also left alone.
- **2026-07-10 · test(e2e) — extend the character-gen e2e harness to cover DM Console's roster import**
  (`testing/scripts/random-manual-e2e.mjs`, `.github/workflows/character-gen-e2e.yml`,
  `testing/README.md`; no app code touched, `DATA.version` unchanged). DM Console's roster view needs no
  cloud/auth — files land via a plain `<input type=file>`. The harness now exports its finished, leveled-
  up character via the same envelope the app's own Save button builds (`_cgEnvelope()`), drops it onto
  DM Console's real file input, switches into table view, and cross-checks the rendered roster row's
  species/class/HP/AC/AP-available against the source tool's own numbers — the one place `dmAnalyze()`
  could still drift from `js/engine.js` despite both going through the same bridge (D-GH36/D-GH37), since
  the risk here is envelope-shape, not computation. Also smoke-tests the Skill Matrix/AP Ledger overlays
  and the column-visibility toggle. DM Console's cloud/campaign features (sign-in, award AP, campaign
  rules) are intentionally not exercised — they need a live Supabase session, not just the CDN stub.
  Verified locally: 5/5 iterations passed across varied species/classes/levels. Also added
  `tools/DM-Console.html` to the CI workflow's trigger paths and corrected `testing/README.md`'s stale
  "9 passed / 0 failed" parity count to the current 20/0 baseline.
- **2026-07-10 · feat — engine module-bridge migration complete across all three tools** (`js/engine.js`,
  `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; parity 20/0, `DATA.version` unchanged).
  Bridged `activeEvents`/`economy`/`foldBuild` (and DM Console's `MUT`) from `js/engine.js` into Live
  Sheet and DM Console — the piece the D-GH26 "safe subset" pass (`DATA`/`compute`/`baseBuild`) left
  hand-copied. Live Sheet and DM Console call these with an index (`foldBuild(uptoIdx)`, for their
  time-travel/scrub UI) via a small local `eventsUpTo(uptoIdx)` helper that slices the tool's own `LOG`
  before handing it to the engine's array-parameter API — every existing call site's signature is
  unchanged, only the bodies now delegate instead of duplicating the fold/economy logic. This was paused
  once (D-GH36) over a real risk — the engine's real replay populates a per-trait `_raceTraitLocked` map
  the tools' old local folds never produced, and `compute()`'s racial-trait pricing depends on it — and
  resumed (D-GH37) once confirmed the app is pre-launch (no real characters to protect) and that no
  tool's UI actually triggers the `creationLocked`/`campaignBound` events this pricing mechanism depends
  on yet, so the risk doesn't functionally bite in production today regardless. Closes the
  `feat/engine-bridge-all-tools` roadmap item — see `DECISIONS.md` D-GH36/D-GH37 and
  `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-engine-bridge-switch-tool-and-live-bugs.md`.
- **2026-07-10 · fix(chargen) — unbounded AP inflation for any character with an active drawback, on every
  save/load/switch cycle (D-GH41, live-production bug)** (`js/engine.js`, `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`;
  `DATA.version` unchanged, no pricing/table change — an internal-value exposure plus two bug fixes to
  code miscomputing an already-correct engine value). CharGen's `#budget` field shows the *combined*
  raw-award-plus-drawback-AP total, but two places (`_cgSyncAward()`'s Step-5 reconcile and
  `_buildEventBurst()`'s whole-LOG regeneration) wrote that combined number back in as if it were the raw
  award — while the drawback's own event kept separately contributing its AP on every future fold,
  compounding without bound on every autosave-restore, file load, and switch-tool handoff. `economy()` now
  exposes the `drawbackEarned` split it already computed internally; both call sites subtract it back out.
  Found and reproduced with the task owner's real uploaded character (one drawback, AP climbing +2 every
  cycle); verified fixed the same way — stable at the mathematically correct total across 4 repeated round
  trips. `engine-parity` 20/0.

- **2026-07-10 · test(ci) — headless Playwright e2e for character gen + advancement (REV-11)**
  (new `testing/scripts/random-manual-e2e.mjs`, `testing/package.json`; new
  `.github/workflows/character-gen-e2e.yml`; `testing/README.md`; no app code touched). Randomly drives
  the real CharGen and Live Sheet UI — species/class selects, ability steppers, skill checkboxes, the
  "Open in Live Sheet"/"Open in CharGen" switch buttons, "+ Award AP", "Level up", buy-panel tiles — with
  its own randomization (never the app's `randomizeBuild()`), and checks the result stays within budget
  and free of unresolved rule warnings. Runs in CI on PRs touching the two tools or `js/engine.js`/
  `js/character-store.js`. Stubs the CDN-hosted Supabase client (`js/supabase-client.js`'s `esm.sh`
  import) so engine boot works offline/in restricted network environments — Supabase is optional, the app
  already runs fully offline against `localStorage`.
- **2026-07-10 · refactor(save-format) — one unified save/export file for both tools (D-GH40)**
  (`js/character-store.js`, `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; no rules
  change; `DATA.version` unchanged). Replaces three divergent save/export shapes — one of which
  re-synthesized a fake LOG instead of the real one, two of which silently dropped `id` on a round trip —
  with a single canonical `{schema:'pact-character/1', rules, name, LOG, SEQ, id}` envelope both tools now
  write and both read (old shapes still load — nothing already saved is stranded). CharGen's separate
  "Export to Live Sheet" button/converter is removed as redundant. Found while manually testing the
  switch-tool feature ("this file won't load right"). Verified: the new module functions directly in plain
  Node, plus a full round trip in a real browser driving CharGen's actual UI (real button clicks) —
  including an old-format file still loading correctly.

- **2026-07-10 · fix(chargen) — ability-score +/- steppers never reached the LOG (D-GH39, live-production
  bug)** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `DATA.version` unchanged). `stepAbil()` set
  the field's value directly and re-rendered, but never dispatched an `input` event — since `st_STR`/etc
  are `readonly`, the stepper was the *only* way to change an ability score, so this silently broke AP
  costing and persistence for every ability-score edit in production. Found via manual testing of D-GH38's
  switch button on Android Chrome. Fixed by dispatching a real `input` event so the stepper goes through
  the same path as a typed value. Confirmed with a real button `.click()` in a headless browser: AP total
  now moves and the change reaches `LOG`.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(tools) — one-click switch between CharGen and Live Sheet on a shared
  `js/character-store.js` (D-GH38)** (new `js/character-store.js`; `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`,
  `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; `service-worker.js` precache + `CACHE_NAME` v2→v3; no rules change,
  `DATA.version` unchanged). Each tool gains an "Open in Live Sheet" / "Open in CharGen" button that carries
  the current character straight to the other tool — no file export/import. **Slice 0:** a shared module
  owns the tool-agnostic handoff transport (`writeHandoff`/`takeHandoff`/`sweepExpiredHandoffs`) plus the
  now-deduplicated `genCharId`; both tools import it (starts correcting the `js/`-shared / `tools/`-UI-only
  rule for persistence). **Slice 1:** the buttons + boot-consume — a same-origin `localStorage`
  per-transfer-key baton (`pact:handoff:<uuid>`, `?handoff=<uuid>` flag only), consume-once, 2-min expiry,
  orphan-key sweep on boot, `?handoff` stripped via `replaceState`. CharGen consumes via the existing
  verbatim `_cgApplyEnvelope` (preserves id); file export/import kept alongside (relabeled "LS file").
  Slice 2 (cloud/campaign round-trip) deferred, isolated so it never blocks the local feature. Two
  ride-along cleanups named but scoped out (dead `_cgBoot` LOG-regeneration scaffolding; wiring
  `creationLocked` into the switch). Plan + two cold reviews + Opus verification pass:
  `docs/plans/2026-07-09-chargen-livesheet-switch-button.md`.

- **2026-07-09 · refactor(tools) — bridge foldBuild/activeEvents/economy to js/engine.js in Live Sheet +
  DM Console (D-GH37)** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; no `compute()`/`DATA`
  table change; `engine-parity` 20/0). Both tools' local, hand-copied `foldBuild`/`activeEvents`/`economy`
  are now thin adapters over the imported `js/engine.js` versions — `activeEvents`/`economy`/`foldBuild`
  no longer have separate implementations anywhere in the codebase. Lifts D-GH36's pause: with this app
  still pre-launch (no real characters to protect), the racial-trait-pricing risk that paused this doesn't
  apply, and bridging actually fixes an existing inconsistency where CharGen and Live Sheet/DM Console
  disagreed on racial-trait pricing for identical characters (see D-GH37 for the full reasoning).

- **2026-07-09 · fix(dm-console) — bridge `MUT` to js/engine.js (D-GH36)** (`tools/DM-Console.html`; no rules
  change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` 20/0). DM Console now imports `MUT` from `js/engine.js` instead
  of a local copy, fixing two confirmed bugs: `found` previously had no else-branch for a second/later
  founded tradition (silently dropped it) and `dbound` wasn't handled at all (DM Console couldn't process
  that event type). The matching `foldBuild`/`activeEvents`/`economy` bridge (the other half of the same
  cold-reviewed plan) is **paused** — it conflicts with D-GH34's already-shipped racial-trait-pricing fix;
  see `docs/plans/2026-07-09-engine-bridge-live-dm-console.md` and D-GH36.

- **2026-07-09 · chore(release) — bump build v0.107 → v0.200; remove the v0 comparison snapshot**
  (`js/engine.js`, `tools/*.html`, `index.html`, `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md`; no rules change; `DATA.version`
  unchanged at v0.332; engine-parity 20/0). Release-prep for the Phase-2 CharGen rewrite (Steps 3–5 + the
  two fixes). Bumped `BUILD` and mirrored it across CharGen (line-1 comment, `<title>`, header `.sub`), the
  Live Sheet (line-1 comment) and DM Console (`TOOL_VERSION`) per `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md`; `index.html` reads
  `BUILD` live. Removed the frozen pre-Phase-2 comparison artifact — the "Character Generator — v0 snapshot"
  menu card in `index.html`, plus `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool-v0.html` and its pinned
  `js/engine-v0-snapshot.js` (nothing else referenced them). Smoke-tested: menu shows one CharGen card and
  "Build v0.200"; CharGen boots clean showing v0.200.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 4, Chunk D: Undo/Redo UI + keyboard shortcuts (Step 4 COMPLETE)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` **20/0**). Final
  chunk: `↶ Undo` / `↷ Redo` buttons in the desktop header cluster and the mobile nav, enabled/disabled from
  live `HIST`/`REDO` depth (refreshed every `render()`, with step-count tooltips). Keyboard: Ctrl/Cmd-Z undo,
  Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-Z or Ctrl-Y redo — while actively typing in a text field (an open coalescing group) Ctrl-Z
  is left to the browser's native text undo; once the field seals it drives the app history. Verified in a
  real browser 13/13 (V6): boot-disabled state, enable/disable transitions across edit→undo→redo, all three
  shortcuts, mid-edit native-undo preservation, typing undisrupted; engine-parity harness re-run **20/0**.
  With this, **CharGen Step 4 is complete** — CharGen has trustworthy snapshot-based undo/redo and persists
  as an event log, matching the Live Sheet.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 4, Chunk C: event-log persistence `{schema,rules,name,budget,LOG,SEQ,id}`**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` stays 20/0). CharGen
  now saves and autosaves in the Live-Sheet-style event-log shape (schema tag `pact-chargen/1`) — a character
  is stored as *what the player did*. `name`/`budget` ride along top-level (Step-5 DOM shims `foldBuild`
  doesn't carry; omitting `budget` would reset it on reload — the F1 finding). `loadFile` now has three
  branches checked in order: (1) schema-tagged CharGen file — keyed **solely** on the schema tag, validates
  `LOG` is an array (errors without touching the build if not), and reinstates the **authoritative saved
  LOG** verbatim rather than trusting applyBuild's DOM re-derivation (which diverges on compute-managed
  fields parked in hidden controls, e.g. `size`) so save↔load is exact; (2) Live-Sheet export (untagged
  `LOG`) — unchanged, with class/species defaults; (3) legacy flat build — unchanged, so every pre-Step-4
  file still opens. Autosave moved to a versioned key with a one-time migration of the old flat-build key
  (applied, rewritten in the new shape, old key deleted). Share links stay flat (URL length). Verified in a
  real browser 15/15 (V5 + V8): envelope shape, save→reset→reload round-trip (canonical-equal, name+budget
  preserved), legacy-flat + Live-Sheet + missing-LOG-error paths, autosave migration+delete, and
  save→load→undo persisted stability.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 4, Chunk B: applyBuild/boot history integration (+ latent randomize-aliasing fix)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` stays 20/0). Wires
  the Chunk-A history core into every whole-build-replacement flow so each is exactly ONE undoable step:
  `applyBuild` now suspends history across its whole DOM-write + LOG-rebuild body (via try/finally), and
  callers own the undo semantics — user file-load and Reset (new `resetBuild()`) push a single pre-action
  frame; randomize pushes one frame and suspends across `applyBuild` + the appearance/name resync; boot,
  autosave-restore, and shared-link load pass `{clearHistory:true}` (you can't undo to "before the character
  existed"), and the initial LOG seed is suspended + cleared. **Latent bug fixed along the way:**
  `randomizeRoll` mutated `readBuild()`'s result in place, but `foldBuild(LOG)` returns nested arrays that
  ALIAS the LOG event payloads — so randomize was silently corrupting the live LOG (harmless pre-Step-4
  because applyBuild rebuilt LOG from the DOM afterward, but the new undo frame snapshotted the corruption);
  fixed by deep-cloning the working build. Verified in a real browser 13/13 (V4): boot leaves history empty;
  load/reset/randomize each push exactly one frame; undo after each restores the pre-action build; randomize
  → undo → redo → undo stays canonical-identical with no history accumulation. Persistence shape + button UI
  are Chunks C/D.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 4, Chunk A: snapshot-based undo/redo history core (no UI yet)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` stays 20/0). First
  chunk of the CharGen undo/redo + persistence work (see
  `docs/plans/2026-07-09-chargen-undo-persist-phase2-step4.md`). Adds a `HIST`/`REDO` snapshot stack (frames
  carry a deep-cloned LOG + the name/budget/id shims), a `commitHistory()` choke point wrapped into the four
  LOG-API functions, `restoreFrame()` (build-equality restore via `applyBuild`, per D5), and `undo()`/`redo()`
  — exercised from the console, not yet wired to buttons (Chunk D). Edit coalescing (D3): only user text
  keystrokes carry a coalesce key; consecutive same-field keystrokes within a 600 ms idle window collapse to
  one undo step, sealed permanently by blur / cross-field / discrete action / undo; net-zero groups are
  dropped (compared on the folded build, not raw LOG bytes). Verified in a real browser 16/16: V1 snapshot
  immutability, V2 undo round-trip (checkbox + patch field + add-row), V3 all four coalescing cases, V7 redo
  symmetry. applyBuild/boot suspension + button UI are Chunks B/D.
- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 5, Chunk B: frame simplification + Step-4 back-compat reconcile (Step 5 COMPLETE)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` 20/0). Now that
  name/budget live in the LOG, the Step-4 undo frames no longer special-case them: `_snapshotFrame` drops
  the `name`/`budget` fields and `restoreFrame` no longer re-writes `#cname`/`#budget` (applyBuild paints
  them from `foldBuild(f.log)`) — which also removes the Step-4 wrinkle where undoing a buy could revert a
  later name edit (name/budget are now independently undoable). Adds a `_cgApplyEnvelope` reconcile: a
  pre-Step-5 (Step-4) saved file can hold a top-level name/budget that differs from a now-stale `name`/`award`
  in its LOG, so after reinstating the authoritative LOG we re-sync the singleton events to the top-level
  values (suspended → no undo frame; a no-op for already-consistent Step-5 files). Verified in a real browser
  10/10 (V4–V5): mixed-edit undo/redo round-trips build **and** name/budget, randomize→undo restores them,
  Step-5 save round-trips name/budget purely via the LOG, a simulated stale Step-4 file heals to its
  top-level values, and legacy flat builds still carry name/budget. **Step 5 complete** — CharGen is now
  fully event-sourced with no DOM-backed build fields.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 5, Chunk A: name + budget are first-class LOG events (shims retired)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` 20/0). Wires live
  `#cname`/`#budget` edits to the engine's native `name`/`award` event types via a coalescing singleton-event
  helper (`_cgSyncSingletonEvent` → `_cgSyncName`/`_cgSyncAward`), routed through `onPatchFieldChange` so
  keystrokes collapse into one undo step. `readBuild()` is now simply `foldBuild(LOG)` — the last two DOM
  shims are gone and the build is FULLY event-sourced. `genName()` (🎲 Generate) now syncs the LOG name
  event too. The budget award is tagged `noLock` and, unlike the Live Sheet, does NOT lock undo history —
  budget stays a freely-editable creation parameter (CharGen's snapshot undo has no award-lock guard).
  Verified in a real browser 15/15 (V1–V3): live edits event-sourced with no DOM override, exactly one
  `name`+one `award` event, name/budget now first-class undo steps, singleton invariant + no-op skip,
  genName sync. Full Step-4 regression (66 checks) + parity stay green. restoreFrame/persistence
  simplification is Chunk B.

- **2026-07-09 · fix(chargen) — export burst dropped `size` and `wornArmour` (CharGen → Live Sheet)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched → `engine-parity` 20/0). Two gaps in
  `_buildEventBurst`: (1) the `'Character size'` patch was **unconditionally** skipped by
  `skipZeroCostPatch`, so a Gnome's chosen size never reached the Live Sheet (removed the size clause — it
  now emits a 0-AP size event like the other free patches); (2) the Armour patch emitted only `armour` (the
  proficiency object), never `wornArmour` (the equipped-armour name), even though the ARMOUR slot is
  `{armour, wornArmour}` together — added `wornArmour` to the patch. Verified in a real browser: a
  Gnome-Small + Leather-Armour build round-trips both fields through export→fold; a default Medium / no-worn-
  armour build round-trips cleanly with no false data.
- **2026-07-09 · fix(chargen) — DM house-rules bar handlers threw `ReferenceError: ck is not defined`**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; engine untouched). `dmAdd`, `dmDisableBuiltin`,
  `dmRemove`, and `dmToggleDisable` each ended with a stray `ck('artck',b.arts||[])` — a copy of
  `applyBuild`'s art re-tick, but `ck` (a local const inside `applyBuild`) and `b` aren't in scope in these
  handlers, so the call threw and the `render()` right after it never ran (grids rebuilt, arts unticked,
  totals stale). Removed the line: `buildArtGrid()` already re-ticks arts from `readBuild().arts` (the LOG)
  post-Step-3-flip, so the call was redundant as well as broken. Verified in a real browser (add / disable /
  toggle / remove custom boons+drawbacks all run without throwing).

- **2026-07-09 · chore(merge) — merge `preview` into `feat/chargen-emit-migration` (parity 16/0 → 20/0)**
  (`testing/`; no rules/tool-logic change). Brought the emit-migration branch up to date with `preview`,
  which had advanced with PR #131 (Live Sheet cloud-status label — auto-merged clean) and PR #136 (four
  new engine-parity fixtures). PR #136 introduced its own CG-004/005/006 + EV-002, colliding with the IDs
  this branch already used for the D-GH34 lock-fallback fixtures; resolved by renumbering PR #136's builds
  to **CG-007/008/009** and its drawback-buyoff event to **EV-010** (files `git mv`d, `test_id`s and CSV
  rows updated with "renumbered from PR #136" notes). The parity harness's one hardcoded prereq-gate
  assertion was repointed from `CG-004` to `CG-007` so it stays on PR #136's fixture (the real browser
  gate caught this — the node mirror did not). Harness now **20/0** (browser + node). No `DATA.version`
  change; both fixture sets coexist.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 6: THE FLIP — CharGen is now event-sourced (emit-migration COMPLETE)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Final
  chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration. `readBuild()` now returns `foldBuild(LOG)` — the event LOG is the
  source of truth; a character *is* its LOG, and CharGen + the Live Sheet are interchangeable views over
  it. `name`/`budget` are read from the DOM as documented Step-3 shims (full event-sourcing of
  budget/awards is Step 5). The DOM stays the input layer (no full repaint — verified typing is
  undisrupted). All shadow-diff/audit scaffolding removed (`canonicalBuild()` retained). The strengthened
  Category-G audit caught a real post-flip bug — `annotate()` auto-unchecked prerequisite-invalid controls
  (expertise without its skill, cross-race trait after a species change, etc.) without retracting the LOG
  event, so `foldBuild(LOG)` kept counting them — fixed with `_cgReconcileChecklistDependents()`
  (retract-only, precision-guarded). Cold-reviewed plan
  (`docs/plans/2026-07-09-chargen-emit-migration-chunk6-flip.md`); the implementation diff independently
  reviewed (8/8 checks passed). Verified: parity 16/0, both LOG_SYNC_GUARDs consistent, all four plan
  invariants pass (Build Projection, LEFTOVER_STATE=0, Budget Validation, and the authoritative-LOG
  proof — suppressing an emit makes a control change stop sticking), full Chunk 0–5 regression green.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 5: whole-build-replacement convergence (LOG synced after every load flow)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Seventh
  chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan. Every whole-build-replacement flow (loadFile — both the
  CharGen-flat and Live-Sheet-LOG branches — loadFromHash, autosave-restore, Reset, randomize) now rebuilds
  LOG from the freshly-written DOM via `replaceWholeLogFromBuild(_domReadBuild())`, so a mid-session load
  leaves LOG in sync with the loaded build (not just at boot). Reading `_domReadBuild()` rather than the
  passed build is load-bearing — randomize's scratch build never holds appearance/name, which go to the DOM
  only. Verified all five plan scenarios (flat load, Live-Sheet-LOG load, shared-link round-trip,
  pre-migration autosave restore, randomize) leave `foldBuild(LOG)` reproducing the DOM's structure and
  compute total; independently reviewed (8/8 passed). Incremental live typing of `name`/`budget` (which
  tie into the Chunk 6 `readBuild()` flip's reconstruction) is deferred to Chunk 6. No user-facing behavior
  change (Option A).

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 4B: traditions/disciplines → one coalescing TRADITIONS patch**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Sixth
  and riskiest chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan (its own rollback boundary). The whole
  `traditions` array is serialized into a single `replacePatchSlot(PATCH_SLOTS.TRADITIONS, ...)` on every
  edit — NEVER a granular indexed `found`/`rank`/`cantrip`/`slot`/`known`/`dbound` event (the plan's hard
  LOG-invariant #7, actively asserted). A `closest('.tcard')` `#form` delegation handles all tradition
  controls (all class-only, no double-handling); the two inline ✕-removal onclicks were converted to
  helpers (the only user-visible change — verified behavior-preserving and more null-safe). The TRADITIONS
  patch carries `traditions` only, not `dabblerCantrips` (owned by the MISC slot since Chunk 2) — verified
  deterministic across interleaved edits. Verified with a caster-heavy golden build (Wizard+Warlock, pact
  slots, arcanum: DOM↔`foldBuild(LOG)` deep-match, total 242==242, one coalesced slot event) and both ✕
  buttons. Independently reviewed (9/9 checks passed, no fixes needed). No user-facing behavior change
  (Option A) beyond the internally-equivalent removal-button refactor.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 4A: customProfs/freeSub wiring + patch-slot hardening + unlockclass fix**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Fifth
  chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan. Wires `customProfs` and `freeSub` (coalescing-patch fields
  whose controls carry no `id`, so Chunk 2's id-keyed delegation missed them) via a new class-keyed patch
  delegation plus add/remove nudges. Extracts a shared `_cgSyncPatchSlot()` no-op-skip primitive (Chunk
  2's cascade had it inlined) and refactors the Category B handlers to use it. Fixes the real
  origin-class ↔ unlockedClasses divergence flagged by Chunk 3's review, via `_cgReconcileUnlockClass()`
  on IDENTITY-slot changes. Independently reviewed (8/8 checks passed, no fixes needed); a comprehensive
  mixed-editing test confirmed DOM and `foldBuild(LOG)` fully agree across all converted fields and total
  AP. No user-facing behavior change (Option A).

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 3: Category C add-row lists + unlockedClasses wired to LOG**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Fourth
  chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan. `unlockedClasses` reused Chunk 1's checkbox-per-value
  mechanism (with a branch for `classunlock`'s `dataset.cls`-not-`value` quirk). `features`/
  `subAbilities`/`subSpellBundles` needed a new multiset-reconciliation function (`_cgSyncFlatCategory`)
  instead, since their add-row UI is dynamic and features can legitimately repeat — a plain set-diff
  would collapse two identical repeatable-feature picks into one LOG event. Found and closed three
  "direct assignment, no event fires" gaps (`addRow()`'s preset path, the row-removal button, and the
  autocomplete's `pick()`), the same class of bug Chunk 1's post-commit fix found for `annotate()`'s
  auto-corrections. Independently reviewed (8/8 checks passed); verified the repeatable-feature case
  directly (2 picks → 2 LOG entries; removing one row → exactly 1 remaining). One latent, pre-existing-
  class gap noted but not fixed (self-heals, invisible under Option A): flagged for Chunk 4A/6.

- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 2: Category B scalar/object fields wired to replacePatchSlot()**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Third
  chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan. All Category B scalar/object fields (stats, hd, profBonus,
  hardy/tough, weaponProf, armour, wornArmour, languages, attune, ki, sorcery, gold, martiallyBound,
  dabblerCantrips, houseRules/DM toggles, appearance, innate spells) now dual-write into `LOG` via
  `replacePatchSlot()`, id-keyed through one delegated `#form` listener. Found and closed a real taxonomy
  gap: `originClass`/`originClass2`/`species`/`species2`/`lineage` were genuine Category B fields missing
  from the cold-reviewed plan's entire field enumeration — grouped under the already-declared-but-unused
  `PATCH_SLOTS.IDENTITY`. Added three new canonical slots (`VIGOR`, `INNATE`, `MISC`) for other orphaned
  fields rather than overloading an unrelated existing slot. The STR<10 armour guard (Category F) is
  enforced both directly and via a STATS→ARMOUR re-patch cascade. An independent review before this
  landed found and fixed: a still-missing `lineage` field, needless LOG churn from an unconditional
  cascade and from `ap_*_lock` UI-only checkboxes false-matching the appearance-field prefix, and an
  undocumented `budget` exclusion. Verified: 21 fields directly confirmed matching between DOM and
  `foldBuild(LOG)`; the repeated-edit cost-delta invariant holds through the full UI path; full regression
  suite green.
- **2026-07-09 · fix(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 1 follow-up: prevent duplicate LOG entries from DOM-side bypass unchecks**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). A second
  independent review of Chunk 1's diff (below) found a real bug after it had already landed:
  `onChecklistToggle`'s CHECK path had no duplicate guard, and several pre-existing `annotate()` DOM-side
  auto-corrections set `.checked=false` directly without dispatching a `change` event — meaning
  `retractFlatEvent()` never ran for them, leaving `LOG` with a stale entry the DOM no longer reflected. A
  later re-check of the same box would then emit a genuine duplicate `LOG` entry. Fixed with an idempotency
  guard: `onChecklistToggle` now no-ops on CHECK if `LOG` already has a matching `(cat, value)` entry.
  Verified by directly simulating the bypass scenario (before: 2 entries after re-check; after: stays at
  1) and confirming a normal check→uncheck→recheck cycle still correctly cycles 1→0→1. Full regression
  suite reconfirmed green.
- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 1: Category A checkboxes + Category D grids wired to LOG**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change, `DATA.version` untouched; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`
  → 16/0). Second chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan. All 12 flat checkbox categories (saves,
  skills, expertise, tool expertise, tools, instruments, masteries, racial traits, racial spells, boons,
  drawbacks, arts) now dual-write into `LOG` via one delegated listener (`onChecklistToggle`), in addition
  to the existing DOM-driven display — DOM stays authoritative (Option A) so this is not a user-visible
  change. Pricing is computed against the current full DOM-derived build, not `foldBuild(LOG)` (which is
  still stale for every category not yet converted) — confirmed to exactly reproduce the existing
  hardcoded drawback-cost formula via direct test. `buildArtGrid`/`buildBoonGrid`/`buildDrawGrid` (Category
  D) converted to read checked-state from `foldBuild(LOG)` instead of `ckVals()`, after tracing every call
  site (boot, `applyBuild`, `applyCampaignCode`, filter re-renders) to confirm the change is safe. Verified
  with real click/restore-flow browser tests plus the parity suite; independently reviewed. Surfaced (not
  fixed — tracked separately) a pre-existing bug: `dmAdd()`/`dmDisableBuiltin()`/`dmRemove()`/
  `dmToggleDisable()` throw `ReferenceError: ck is not defined` when called, unrelated to this chunk.
- **2026-07-09 · feat(chargen) — Phase 2 Step 3, Chunk 0: LOG mutation API + shadow-diff scaffolding (no behavior change)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change, `DATA.version` untouched; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`
  → 16/0). First chunk of the CharGen emit()-migration plan (cold-reviewed:
  `docs/plans/2026-07-09-chargen-emit-migration-phase2-step3.md`). Adds CharGen-local `LOG`/`SEQ` and the
  sole LOG-mutation surface (`emit`, `retractFlatEvent`, `replacePatchSlot`, `replaceWholeLogFromBuild`),
  a runtime-enforced `RETRACTABLE_FLAT_CATS` allowlist and `PATCH_SLOTS` registry, and a dev-only
  (`?cgShadow=1`) pre/post-render shadow-diff comparing the DOM-derived build against `foldBuild(LOG)`,
  backed by four LOG-invariant assertions. `readBuild()` (renamed original kept as `_domReadBuild()`) still
  returns the DOM-derived build — Option A, the flip to `foldBuild(LOG)` is deferred to the plan's final
  cleanup chunk — so this chunk changes no visible behavior; verified via a live DOM interaction (racial
  trait checkbox still re-prices correctly, `LOG` stays frozen at its boot snapshot since no handler is
  converted yet) and a full parity run. `buildToLiveLog()`'s event-burst logic is factored out into a
  shared `_buildEventBurst()`/`buildToEventLog()` (used to seed `LOG` once at boot) with no behavior change
  to `buildToLiveLog()` itself — confirmed via the same before/after round-trip check used for the D-GH34
  fix. Building the shadow-diff surfaced two pre-existing, unrelated gaps in the CharGen→Live-Sheet export
  burst (present before this chunk, not introduced by it): `size` is never exported (an unconditional
  `||` in `emitPatch`'s `skipZeroCostPatch` check always skips the "Character size" patch), and
  `wornArmour` has a real `MUT` mutator but was never wired into the burst at all. Deliberately not fixed
  here — output as a roadmap item for a human to fold in (see chat) rather than slipped into a
  "no behavior change" scaffolding chunk.
- **2026-07-09 · refactor(engine,chargen,testing) — post-D-GH34 code review cleanup pass**
  (`js/engine.js`; `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`;
  `testing/fixtures/events/*`; `DATA.version` unchanged — no `compute()` behavior change;
  `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). Follow-up cleanup for six lower-priority findings
  from the D-GH34 code review, all verified to change no engine output: (1) `_replay()`'s two
  passes merged into one loop, with spend-classification logic factored into a shared
  `_spendCost()` helper used by both `_replay()` and `economy()`; (2) dead `SOFT_WARN`/`isAdvisory`
  regex clauses referencing the removed "priced at character-creation" warning text removed from
  both `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html` and `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; (3) the v0 snapshot's
  pre-existing rule exception left as-is (already disclosed and intentional, no code change needed);
  (4) CharGen's `liveBase()` — a standalone scratch-object constructor that had drifted out of sync
  with the engine's `baseBuild()` — now derives from the imported `baseBuild()` with an explicit
  `inPlay=false` override; a naive delete-and-reuse of `baseBuild()` was checked first and found to
  silently regress `buildToLiveLog()`'s racial-trait export pricing (`baseBuild()`'s `inPlay:true`
  default now has real pricing meaning under D-GH34's fallback), so the override is kept and
  commented as load-bearing, not a leftover; (5) `_lsImportFold()`, a one-line pass-through wrapper
  left over from the D-GH33 swap to the real `foldBuild()`, deleted and inlined at its single call
  site; (6) the 8 near-identical `baseSnapshot` objects duplicated across `EV-002`–`EV-009` collapsed
  into one shared fixture (`testing/fixtures/events/_shared/base-halfling.json`), referenced via a new
  `baseSnapshotRef` field the harness's loader resolves relative to each fixture's own path. Verified
  via the full parity suite (still 16/0), a browser round-trip re-check of `buildToLiveLog()`'s racial-
  trait pricing (unchanged), and a live run of the browser test harness confirming every
  `baseSnapshotRef` resolves correctly.
- **2026-07-08 · fix(engine) — restore racial-trait pricing in Live Sheet & DM Console; wire noLock into CharGen's export (D-GH34)**
  (`js/engine.js`; `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; `DATA.version` v0.334→v0.335; 3 new fixtures
  `CG-004`–`CG-006`; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 16/0). An 8-angle code review of D-GH31/32/33
  found a live, shipping regression: `compute()`'s racial-trait pricing had switched from an
  always-`true` whole-build flag to a per-trait map only the engine's own internal replay populates —
  and Live Sheet and DM Console each have their own separate, hand-copied local fold logic that never
  calls that replay, so racial-trait pricing in both tools silently and permanently dropped to the cheap
  creation rate for every character. A related display feature (the "paying a premium vs. creation-basis
  pricing" banner) went inert for the same reason. Separately, `buildToLiveLog()` never tagged its
  emitted events `noLock:true`, leaving the mechanism built specifically for that scenario (D-GH31)
  unused in the one function that needed it. Fixed via a cold-reviewed plan
  (`docs/plans/2026-07-08-racial-trait-pricing-regression-fix.md`): `compute()` now checks
  `_raceTraitLocked` by key **presence**, not truthiness, falling back to the old `inPlay`-based
  behavior when a trait has no entry at all — restoring the two affected tools' exact pre-regression
  pricing with no changes to either tool's own files. `buildToLiveLog()`'s single event-emission funnel
  now tags every event `noLock:true` unconditionally. Verified directly (both the pricing restoration and
  the noLock fix) and via three new fixtures, one specifically constructed so a future regression back to
  truthiness-only checking would fail a test instead of shipping silently. See D-GH34 for the full record
  and the general lesson about replay-derived engine state and independently-constructed callers.
- **2026-07-08 · fix(chargen) — import real js/engine.js MUT/foldBuild/activeEvents/economy/baseBuild; fixes a real multi-discipline import bug (D-GH33, Phase 2 step 2)**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; no rules change, `DATA.version` untouched by this step). CharGen's
  module bridge now imports `MUT`/`foldBuild`/`activeEvents`/`economy`/`baseBuild` from `js/engine.js`
  alongside its existing `DATA`/`compute`, replacing two local throwaway copies. A parity check (required
  by the Phase 2 plan before this swap) found real drift matching a divergence already documented for DM
  Console's separate local `MUT`: the local `found` mutator silently dropped a second discipline added to
  an already-founded tradition, and `dbound` (discipline-bound flag) didn't exist locally at all — so a
  multi-discipline or bound-discipline character exported from Live Sheet and re-imported into CharGen
  silently lost that data. Fixed automatically by the swap, verified in a real browser (a synthetic
  two-discipline-plus-`dbound` LOG now round-trips correctly; a representative build round-trips through
  export→import at an identical price). CharGen's live editing UI (~75 handler sites, `readBuild()`,
  `render()`) is untouched — only the import/export paths changed. See D-GH33.
- **2026-07-08 · feat(engine) — automatic `creationLocked` now requires campaign binding (D-GH32, Phase 2 step 1)**
  (`js/engine.js`; `DATA.version` v0.333→v0.334; 2 new fixtures `EV-008`/`EV-009`; `EV-003`/`EV-007`
  updated to include a `campaignBound` event; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 13/0). First engine
  increment of Phase 2 (see `docs/plans/2026-07-08-chargen-livesheet-unification-phase2.md`): the
  automatic (threshold-crossing) `creationLocked` trigger now only fires for a character that has a
  `campaignBound` event somewhere in its LOG — a purely local, never-campaign-bound character (CharGen's
  standalone use case) never auto-locks via spend alone, only via an explicit action. The explicit
  `creationLocked` event stays unconditional. A late `campaignBound` event fires the automatic lock
  retroactively at the point of binding, not applied to purchases before it. `campaignBound` is unrelated
  to the existing `cat:'campaign'`/`b.campaign` mutator, which is Live Sheet's local offline house-rules
  code-paste feature (`applyCampaignCode()`) — flagged clearly in code comments and D-GH32 to prevent
  future confusion between the two. See D-GH32 for the full rationale.
- **2026-07-08 · chore — freeze a CharGen v0 snapshot for Phase 2 side-by-side comparison**
  (new `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool-v0.html`, new `js/engine-v0-snapshot.js`; `index.html` gets a new
  linked card; no rules change, `DATA.version` untouched). Ahead of the Phase 2 CharGen rewrite (the
  D-GH31 unification effort), snapshot the pre-Phase-2 tool + its exact engine dependency as of commit
  `eb113be` so the owner can compare old-vs-new behavior side by side once Phase 2 lands on the real
  `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`. `PACT-CharGen-Webtool-v0.html` pins its module-bridge import to
  `js/engine-v0-snapshot.js` (a frozen copy of `js/engine.js`, `DATA.version` v0.333) instead of the live
  engine, so its behavior can't drift as Phase 2 work continues — deliberately breaks the "one engine"
  rule for this one throwaway comparison artifact only, flagged in both files' headers. Not added to
  `service-worker.js`'s `PRE_CACHE` list (a temporary comparison tool doesn't need offline pre-caching).
  Delete both files (and the `index.html` card) once the comparison is no longer needed.
- **2026-07-08 · feat(engine) — `creationLocked` event/threshold replaces the dead `b.inPlay` flag (D-GH31, Phase 1 of 3)**
  (`js/engine.js`; `DATA.version` v0.332→v0.333; 6 new fixtures `EV-002`–`EV-007`;
  `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` → 11/0). Engine-only phase of a larger CharGen/Live-Sheet
  unification: a new `creationLocked` LOG event, plus automatic inference once cumulative AP spend
  crosses `DATA.level1AP`, now drives racial/species-trait pricing — replacing a flag that was
  unconditionally `true` for every character and therefore inert. Tagging is **per-purchase** (via
  `_replay`), not a whole-build flag, specifically because a whole-build flag would reproduce D-GH30's
  exact bug shape (a later state retroactively repricing earlier purchases) — caught by a cold review of
  the implementation plan before any code was written. A second gap, found only by actually building and
  testing the mechanism: a one-shot import/creation burst above the anchor would self-trigger the
  automatic lock partway through, mispricing traits bought later in that same burst. Fixed with an
  event-level `noLock: true` flag that exempts specific events from the automatic-threshold accumulation
  (real AP accounting is unaffected) — verified by `EV-006`/`EV-007`. See D-GH31 for the full design
  record, the cold-review outcome, and a build-time correction (the implementation plan wrongly assumed
  `DATA.level1AP` didn't exist; it already did, as `50`). No tool UI changes in this phase — CharGen,
  Live Sheet, and DM Console are all untouched, so nothing about either tool's real behavior changes yet.
  Supersedes and closes the `feat/ap-model-reconcile` NEXT item (D-GH30's deferred follow-up).
- **2026-07-08 · docs — correct stale roadmap text around the engine module-bridge migration; graduate "Task 6"**
  (`docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`; no code/rules change). `/pick-task` surfaced that the NOW item "Full engine
  module-bridge migration" still described the original all-seven-symbols scope even though a first pass
  already shipped a reduced "safe subset" (D-GH26, PR #121) — rewrote it to describe only the actually
  remaining work (`activeEvents`/`economy`/`foldBuild` reconciliation, CharGen's and DM Console's
  divergent `MUT`). Also found the separate NEXT item "Task 6 — CharGen module bridge migration" was
  already fully done by that same D-GH26 pass (CharGen's `DATA`/`compute()` bridge) but never graduated —
  removed it and updated the four other roadmap items that still gated on "Task 6" as if it were open
  (`feat/chargen-campaign-rules` now correctly blocked on CharGen not yet importing `validate()`, not the
  old gate; `feat/ap-by-level` and AUD-1's version-sync follow-up are now unblocked; `feat/save-integrity`'s
  stale coordination note dropped; AUD-1's main drift check narrowed to just `MUT`, since `DATA`/`compute`/

- **2026-07-08 · docs — fold the `feat/ap-model-reconcile` item into the roadmap**
  (`docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`; no code/rules change). The owner reviewed the output block from
  the prior commit and asked for it to be added directly — folds in the NEXT item deferred from D-GH30
  (whether `js/engine.js` should grow a frozen-ledger-aware remaining-AP export, or the current per-tool
  compute()/economy() split is the permanent design).
- **2026-07-08 · docs — session note for the AP-display fix; revert a roadmap single-writer slip**
  (`docs/sessions/2026-07-08-livesheet-ap-display-fix.md`; `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`; no
  code/rules change). `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md` is single-writer — agents must output new items for the
  human to fold in, never append directly. The prior commit did that correctly when it *removed* the
  resolved `fix/livesheet-undo-bug` item, but then directly appended the new `feat/ap-model-reconcile`
  NEXT item instead of outputting it. This commit reverts that append (the item is re-posted as a plain
  output block below, for the owner to fold in by hand) and adds the session note documenting the wrong
  root-cause premise and the Option A/B decision behind D-GH30.
- **2026-07-08 · fix(live-sheet) — "AP left" now reads the frozen ledger instead of a retroactive recompute**
  (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no `js/engine.js` change, no `DATA.version` bump).
  Investigating the reported `fix/livesheet-undo-bug` roadmap task disproved its premise — `undo()` was
  already correct (verified against a full LOG re-fold across every event type). The actual bug: buying a
  cross-class feature then binding that class (Martially/Magically Bound) made the headline "AP left"
  drift 1 AP above what the buy-gate would actually let you spend, because it read `compute().remaining`
  (which retroactively discounts earlier purchases of the bound class) instead of the frozen-ledger
  `economy().available` already used to gate purchases. Fixed all three "AP left" displays (desktop econ
  line, mobile sticky bar, floating badge) to read `eco.available`. See D-GH30 in `DECISIONS.md` for the
  full write-up and the deferred long-term reconciliation, now tracked as a new NEXT roadmap item
  (`feat/ap-model-reconcile`).
- **2026-07-09 · docs(agents) — add Supabase advisor/log check to the per-change checklist** (`AGENTS.md`;
  no code/rules change). Step 4 of the per-change checklist now requires running the Supabase advisor
  (`get_advisors`) and skimming recent logs (`get_logs`) after any migration/RLS/schema change, before
  opening the PR — this project has already been bitten twice by grant/RLS drift that internal guards
  masked (D-GH15, D-GH12). Closes roadmap item "Add Supabase advisor/log check to the per-change
  checklist".
- **2026-07-09 · docs(github) — add PR template with per-change checklist + review-cadence line**
  (`.github/pull_request_template.md`, new file; `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`). Every new PR against this repo
  now auto-populates with AGENTS.md's per-change checklist (parity gate, CHANGELOG/DECISIONS/sessions
  updates, roadmap graduation, version-sync check) plus a review-cadence reminder: run `/code-review`
  (low/medium) before merge, `/code-review ultra` specifically for PRs touching `js/engine.js` or `sql/`.

- **2026-07-09 · test — expand engine-parity coverage past the 5 budget/empty/over-budget fixtures** (`testing/tests/engine-parity.html`, `testing/fixtures/builds/CG-004..006-*.json`, `testing/fixtures/events/EV-002-drawback-buyoff.json`, `testing/expected/expected-results.csv`; test-coverage only — `js/engine.js`/`DATA` untouched, `DATA.version` unchanged). Audited `compute()`'s branches against the 5 existing fixtures and found no coverage of prereq-gate rejection, drawback buy-off, racial/mastery discount stacking, or multi-tradition spellcasting. Added 4 new fixtures, each captured via Node import of `js/engine.js` (the documented CLI-agent method in `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`) and hand-verified against the Player's Guide before pinning into the CSV: **CG-004** (expertise-without-skill + mastery-without-weapon-prof + duplicate-feature + medium-armour-without-STR-10 — all warn but stay valid, confirming gates inform rather than block), **CG-005** (a Halfling's non-pack racial trait re-priced from its 4 AP creation cost to 13 AP when bought in-play at Tier 4, plus 2-mastery ladder stacking), **CG-006** (two separate Arcane/Divine traditions each paying their own Foundation+Rank, vs. one tradition with 2 disciplines), and **EV-002** (a drawback bought then bought off at 3× cost — ends up fully absent from the folded build and its AP line, regardless of buy/buyoff event order, since `activeEvents()` pre-scans the whole log for `buyoff` entries before replay starts). Engine-parity now reports **9 passed / 0 failed**. See `docs/sessions/2026-07-09-expand-engine-parity-coverage.md` for the gap audit and the CG-003-style bespoke assertion added for CG-004.
- **2026-07-08 · chore(skills) — `/pick-task` and `/run-task` now suggest a Haiku/Sonnet/Opus engine tier per task**
  (`.claude/commands/pick-task.md`, `.claude/commands/run-task.md`; skill-only, no rules/code change).
  `pick-task`'s Step 3 "Check 2" was a binary Sonnet-floor/Opus-escalation check; it's now a three-tier
  recommendation — Haiku for tasks that came through Step 2's quick/difficulty filter (docs-only,
  config/manifest, single-file CSS/copy, isolated obvious-cause fixes), Sonnet as the floor for a normal
  full roadmap task, Opus only for real rework risk (engine rules logic, data-model/migration decisions,
  cross-tool contracts, genuine architectural trade-offs). Effort stays a separate axis (default High,
  escalate to `xhigh`/`max` only for genuinely ambiguous judgment calls). Step 4's hand-off now reports
  the suggested engine per task and tells the user to run `/model <engine>` first if the session isn't
  already on it, since neither skill can switch the running model itself; `run-task` restates the
  inherited suggestion before Step 4 (enter worktree) for the same reason.
- **2026-07-08 · fix — surface cloud/campaign status in CharGen + Live Sheet** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; `js/engine.js` diff is empty — parity 5/0). CharGen now shows a persistent "🔒 Local only — not connected to any cloud campaign" badge in its header, and its local, text-code house-rules feature (previously labeled "🛡 Campaign" — a naming collision with the real cloud campaign system) is relabeled "🛡 House rules code" with a clarified tooltip and modal copy. Live Sheet gains a persistent status badge next to the ☁ Cloud button, outside its dropdown, showing sign-in state and — when the loaded character has a `campaign_id` — the campaign name plus whether the DM's rules were actually fetched: "☁ Campaign: <name> — DM rules active" vs a warning "⚠ Campaign: <name> — rules unavailable" if the fetch failed or returned nothing. No enforcement/validation behavior changed (`validate()`, `cloudRuleBarred()`, the live-filter pickers are untouched); the badge only reads state `refreshCloudCampaignRules()` and the cloud-character-load handler already compute. See DECISIONS.md D-GH42 (originally logged as D-GH30, renumbered — see its addendum).
  Closes the "Cloud/campaign state is invisible to players" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-08 · docs(skills) — fold three proven worktree gotchas into `/run-task`** (`.claude/commands/run-task.md`;
  no code/rules change). PACT sessions have independently hit and fixed three `EnterWorktree`/`preview_start`/
  `ExitWorktree` gotchas over the past week (now indexed as H-018/H-027/H-028 in the cross-project
  `ai-lessons-learned` repo, all three sourced from this repo's own past sessions): `EnterWorktree` can
  silently base a new worktree on a stale branch snapshot, `preview_start` resolves `launch.json` against
  the main repo root rather than the worktree's, and `ExitWorktree`'s "N commits will be discarded" refusal
  can count already-pushed upstream commits pulled in by a rebase. Adds a verify-the-base check to Step 4, a
  `preview_start`/`launch.json` caveat to Step 5, and an `ExitWorktree` refusal caveat to Step 8, so future
  `/run-task` runs don't rediscover the same three issues from scratch. `docs/sessions/2026-07-08-worktree-gotcha-docs.md`
  has the full context.
- **2026-07-08 · docs — fix the recurring D-GH decision-number collision (D-GH43, originally logged as
  D-GH30 — itself collided and was renumbered; see its addendum)** (`DECISIONS.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`; no code/rules change). Three prior collisions (D-GH19/20, D-GH25/27, D-GH26/28) all traced to
  computing "next number = highest + 1" from a stale local read instead of the live remote. Adds a documented
  rule — check `origin/preview`'s live `DECISIONS.md` before claiming a new number — plus formalizes
  renumber-on-merge as the accepted fallback if a collision still happens (the same pattern already used to
  resolve all three prior incidents, now made explicit policy instead of an ad hoc scramble). Sourced from
  the cross-project `ai-lessons-learned` repo's H-022 lesson (chompy78/ai-lessons-learned).

Covers PR #121 / D-GH26: the roadmap task's premise being wrong (three of the seven "hand-copied" symbols are signature-incompatible `LOG`-closures, DM's `MUT` diverges), the owner's choice of the safe subset (`DATA`/`compute`/`baseBuild` + Live Sheet `MUT`) over the full migration, the ES-module-deferral `engine-ready` gating gotcha, in-browser verification, and the two rebases (PR #108/#109 bootstrap conflicts + D-GH24→26 number churn, with D-GH26 turning out to be the number preview reserved for this task).

  (`docs/sessions/2026-07-05-theme-artwork-and-worktree-base.md`; no code/rules change). Covers PRs
  #111, #113, #114, #120: the theme-artwork task's pivot history (SVG placeholders → real dark art →
  per-theme restructuring → restoring old assets into `midnight`), the `D-GH26` decision-number
  collision caught pre-merge, and a recurring `EnterWorktree` stale-base-branch gotcha worth
  checking for on every future worktree entry.

- **2026-07-05 · feat — dedicated per-theme homepage artwork for all 4 themes; swap the Player's Guide cover to webp**
  (`index.html`, `AGENTS.md`; new `assets/themes/{parchment,midnight,dragonfire,contrast}/*.webp`,
  `assets/pact-cover.webp`; deleted `pact-cover.jpg`, the now-superseded `assets/themes/light/`,
  `assets/themes/dark/`, and duplicate `images/` originals already archived in `source-assets/images/`;
  display-only, no `DATA.version` change). The project owner supplied dedicated banner art for all four
  named themes (2 images each), superseding the previous light/dark-bucket model from the prior entry —
  `artPools` in `index.html`'s theme-switcher script is now keyed by theme name directly
  (`parchment`/`midnight`/`dragonfire`/`contrast`), each re-rolling independently on switch with
  immediate-repeat avoidance, so a theme only ever shows art actually made for it. Also swaps the
  `<img class="cover">` Player's Guide thumbnail (and its `og:image`/`twitter:image` meta tags) from
  `pact-cover.jpg` to a smaller `assets/pact-cover.webp`, supplied by the project owner. The project owner
  also asked to keep the two original dark-theme book banners (`book-closed-banner.webp`,
  `book-open-banner.webp`, previously in the deleted `assets/themes/dark/`) rather than discard them —
  restored from git history into `assets/themes/midnight/` and added to `artPools.midnight` alongside its
  2 dedicated images (now 4 total in that pool; static asset pools are hand-listed in `index.html`, not
  auto-discovered from the directory — every file has to be named explicitly). Verified with a headless
  Chromium run cycling all 4 themes and 12 re-rolls within `midnight` alone, confirming each theme (and
  all 4 midnight variants) loads its own art and the cover image loads correctly; engine sanity check
  unaffected (asset-only change). See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH28's update for why the light/dark bucket model
  was retired.
- **2026-07-05 · feat — swap in real dark-theme homepage artwork; add a `source-assets/` originals archive**
- **2026-07-05 · docs — gate + tighten the `plan-for-review` skill for cold M365 Copilot review; add an AGENTS.md Active Priorities block**
  (`.claude/commands/plan-for-review.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md`; new `docs/SKILLS.md`; no
  code/rules change). Formalises the observed-useful
  Claude→Copilot→Claude loop: Claude drafts a self-contained plan, M365 Copilot critiques it *cold* (no repo
  access, judging plan quality not code correctness), Claude triages the feedback and implements. The skill
  now opens with a trigger gate — *use cold review only if a wrong approach would cost more than one
  implementation cycle to undo* — so trivial/single-file/mechanical work skips it. The generated package is
  built from context already gathered while planning (no re-reading to pad), capped at ≤1.5 pages, and gains
  explicit **Assumptions-vs-verified-facts**, **Files involved**, **Verification**, and **Review outcome**
  sections; reviewer instructions are reframed for a no-repo cold reviewer with an anti-churn "say so if it's
  solid" note. Adds a short `## Active Priorities` block near the top of `AGENTS.md` (cached pointer to the
  roadmap, not a second copy, filled with the current 🔴 NOW focus) and documents the cold-review loop —
  with its trigger rule — in the AGENTS.md Agent-guidance rubric so future sessions know when to reach for
  it. Adds a human-readable `docs/SKILLS.md` (what each skill does + how they chain into the task lifecycle,
  plus the cold-review loop) and refreshes `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md` to be Claude-Code-centric — Claude Code as
  the primary tool with M365 Copilot as cold reviewer only, dropping the stale "VS Code Copilot as co-equal
  coding tool" framing. Rationale and the rejected alternatives (OneDrive mirror, separate
  PACT-AI-CONTEXT.md, Copilot as repo-aware planner) are in `DECISIONS.md` D-GH29 and this session's notes;
  no `DATA.version` change.
  (`index.html`, `AGENTS.md`; new `source-assets/README.md`; moved `images/book-*.webp` →
  `assets/themes/dark/`, `images/originals/*` → `source-assets/images/`; deleted the now-superseded
  `starfield.svg`/`dragon-ember.svg` placeholders; no `DATA.version` change). The project owner supplied
  real dark-theme artwork (4 grimoire/spellbook `.webp` images); `artPools.dark` in `index.html` now uses
  those instead of the placeholder SVGs from the previous entry. Introduces `source-assets/` as a general
  (not image-specific) home for full-resolution originals behind any optimized/served asset, kept out of
  every agent's read path via a new `AGENTS.md` "don't read wholesale" bullet plus its own README
  explaining the optimize-then-commit workflow. Renumbers this branch's own `D-GH26` decision to `D-GH28`
  after a rebase surfaced that `D-GH26` is explicitly reserved for the engine module-bridge migration task
  — see `DECISIONS.md` D-GH28's addendum. Light theme pool unchanged (still placeholder SVGs; no real
  light-theme art supplied yet). Re-verified with the same headless Chromium theme-cycling check; engine
  sanity check unaffected (asset-only change).
- **2026-07-05 · fix — resolve a `D-GH25` collision on `preview`, plus a squash-merge duplicate line**
  (`DECISIONS.md`, `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`; no code/rules change). Two independent sessions both claimed
  `D-GH25` (this session's `/pick-task` batching decision, and PR #113's leaked-password-protection
  retirement) — both squash-merges landed cleanly with no conflict, silently concatenating the duplicate
  header instead of surfacing it, the same failure mode as the prior `D-GH19`/`D-GH20` incidents.
  Renumbered the batching decision to `D-GH27` (`D-GH26` stays reserved for the engine module-bridge
  migration task) and fixed the roadmap's now-stale "next free" reference. Also found and fixed an
  unrelated duplicated line in the `D-GH24` entry, introduced by the same squash-merge.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — theme-aware random homepage artwork** (`index.html`; new `assets/themes/light/*.svg`,
  `assets/themes/dark/*.svg`; display-only, no `DATA.version` change). Adds a decorative banner above the
  masthead that randomly picks one image from the active theme's pool on load and re-rolls on every theme
  switch — `parchment`/`contrast` draw from the light pool, `midnight`/`dragonfire` from the dark pool
  (matches the existing theme system's own light/dark split), with immediate-repeat avoidance so switching
  within the same bucket doesn't show the same image twice in a row. Artwork is hand-authored original SVG
  (no image-generation tool available, and fetching third-party art risked unclear licensing), palette-matched
  to each theme's existing CSS custom properties. Verified with a headless Chromium run cycling every theme
  option and confirming the art src/bucket pairing and image load (see D-GH28 for why SVG over photos).

- **2026-07-04 · docs — retire the "enable Supabase Auth leaked-password protection" roadmap item** (`docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md` D-GH25; no code/rules change). Supabase gates this Auth feature behind a paid plan tier; the project owner declined to upgrade for it. Removed from the roadmap rather than left open indefinitely — the security advisor (`auth_leaked_password_protection`) will keep flagging it, so the gap stays visible without a stale TODO.
- **2026-07-04 · docs — session note + D-GH24 for the theme-selector fix's `<head>` trade-off**
  (`DECISIONS.md`, `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/sessions/2026-07-04-theme-selector-and-worktree-cwd.md`;
  no code/rules change). Follow-up to PR #109: `D-GH24` records why the theme-restore check stayed at
  the end of `<body>` instead of moving inline into `<head>` like `index.html` (the tools' theme CSS is
  `body`-scoped, not `documentElement`-scoped, so the early-run trick isn't a drop-in port). The session
  note also covers the `/pick-task` difficulty-word fix and a mid-session worktree-cwd hiccup (absolute-path
  `Edit`/`Write` calls landed in the shared main repo instead of the active worktree after a context
  continuation). Also fixes `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`'s stale "next free is D-GH24" reference (now D-GH25).
- **2026-07-04 · feat — `/pick-task` can batch several quick, non-overlapping tasks into one PR**
  (`.claude/commands/pick-task.md`, `.claude/commands/run-task.md`, `AGENTS.md`; no code/rules change).
  When `/pick-task`'s difficulty-filter path (e.g. "quick"/"fast"/"easy") picks a task, it now also scans
  the rest of NOW/NEXT/LATER for up to 2 more independently small, low-risk, non-file-overlapping
  candidates, pre-flights each one separately (branch collision + effort/model escalation — a candidate
  that fires either drops out of the batch rather than blocking the primary pick), and offers a
  "batch `<primary>` + N more" option alongside "run just the primary" in its confirmation.
  `/run-task` now accepts multiple space-separated `<type/short-slug>` arguments: each task still gets
  its own edit, its own commit, and its own `CHANGELOG.md`/roadmap-graduation line — only the
  worktree/branch, the final `engine-parity` run, the rebase, and the PR are shared once across the
  batch, amortizing that fixed overhead instead of paying it per task. `AGENTS.md`'s "one task per
  branch" note now documents this as the one explicit exception (see `DECISIONS.md` D-GH27 — originally
  logged as D-GH25, renumbered after colliding with PR #113's independent use of the same number; see
  `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`'s follow-up fix in this same change).
- **2026-07-04 · feat — `/pick-task` ends with a clickable confirmation instead of copy-paste text**
  (`.claude/commands/pick-task.md`; no code/rules change). Step 4's hand-off now asks via
  `AskUserQuestion` whether to start work, with options to run `/run-task <slug>` immediately in the
  same turn, wait, or go back and choose a different roadmap item (looping back through Step 3's
  pre-flight for the new pick) — replacing the old "Say `/run-task <slug>`" line that had to be retyped.
- **2026-07-04 · fix — reliable Save/Export on iOS Safari & PWA, plus a CharGen autosave safety net**
  (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display/reliability-only, no
  `DATA.version` bump). Every blob+`<a download>` save/export site (CharGen `saveBuild()`,
  `exportToLiveSheet()`; Live Sheet `exportJSON()`) now feature-detects `navigator.canShare({files})`
  and, where available, hands the file to `navigator.share()` so it goes through the native Share sheet
  instead of the anchor-download trick, which iOS Safari/PWA is known to silently no-op or misroute to a
  new tab. Replaces CharGen's old UA-sniffed iOS data-URI branch entirely. `navigator.share()` rejection
  is now caught and flashed instead of failing silently (distinct message for a user cancel vs. a real
  failure); the desktop/Android anchor-download fallback is unchanged. Save/Export button tooltips are
  now set per-capability at load (e.g. "Save (via Share menu)" vs. "Save to Downloads") instead of one
  static string. CharGen also gains a `pactCharGenAutosave` localStorage safety net (mirrors Live Sheet's
  existing `save()`/`load()` pattern, raw build JSON only) — until now Export was CharGen's *only*
  persistence, so a failed/abandoned export meant total, permanent loss of the in-progress build.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — narrow `/pick-task` Step 1's fetch from four files to three** (`.claude/commands/pick-task.md`;
  no code/rules change). Drops the `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` `git show` (10KB) since it contributes
  nothing toward the "current expected pass count" fact — that number is just the row count in
  `testing/expected/expected-results.csv`, which is fetched separately and far cheaper (735B).
- **2026-07-04 · fix — theme selector reachable on mobile, no longer clips on desktop; add system
  dark-mode default** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`;
  display-only, no `DATA.version` bump). CharGen's `.hd-row2` (title/version/last-edited/🎨 theme
  dropdown) was `display:none` below 768px with no mobile substitute — the theme selector was simply
  unreachable on phones. Added a compact `#themeselMobile` select to `.hd-mobnav`, kept in sync with the
  desktop `#themesel` via `setTheme()`. Also gave `.hd-row2` `flex-wrap:wrap` so it can no longer
  visually clip the dropdown at narrow/zoomed desktop widths (previously one non-wrapping flex row).
  Live Sheet's `#themesel` already lives inside its always-reachable "More" dropdown, so no layout
  change was needed there. Both tools' theme-restore IIFE now falls back to
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` (mapped to the existing `dark` theme) when nothing is saved in
  `localStorage`, matching `index.html`'s pattern — first-time visitors on a dark-preferring device now
  get dark mode by default. Left the restore check running where it already did (near the end of
  `<body>`, not inline in `<head>` like `index.html`) — the tools' theme CSS is scoped to
  `body[data-theme=...]`, not `:root`/`html`, so an early `<head>`-run script can't apply the theme
  before body parses without also converting every theme selector; that's a larger refactor left for a
  follow-up rather than folded into this fix.
- **2026-07-04 · fix — add `BUILD` export to `js/engine.js`, wire `index.html` to read it live** (`js/engine.js` now exports `BUILD = "v0.107"`; `index.html` imports it in a new module-script block and renders it in the footer). Closes a docs/code drift found in a 2026-07-02 audit: `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` and the 2026-07-01 CU-2 entry below both claimed this mechanism already existed — it didn't (`git log -S"export const BUILD"` had zero hits ever). This corrects that false claim. The three tools' hand-maintained version labels (CharGen title/header, Live Sheet comment, DM Console `TOOL_VERSION`) are unchanged for now — Task 6 (CharGen module-bridge migration) is the natural point to wire those to read `BUILD` live too. Display-only/tooling; `DATA.version` untouched; parity still 5/0.
- **2026-07-05 · feat(tools) — bridge `DATA`/`compute`/`baseBuild` onto `js/engine.js` in all three tools (safe subset of the engine module-bridge migration)** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`, `AGENTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`; no rules change, `DATA.version` still v0.332). Each tool now imports `DATA`, `compute`, `baseBuild` (Live Sheet also `MUT`) from `js/engine.js` in a `<script type="module">` that copies them onto `window` and fires a new `engine-ready` event, on which each tool's UI bootstrap is gated. Deleted the inline `DATA`/`compute` (all three), `baseBuild` (Live Sheet, DM Console) and `MUT` (Live Sheet) copies; moved each tool's display-only `DATA.racialFx` map into its module bridge. CharGen got its first module bridge. **Not** bridged (deferred — a compat check found they'd break the tools): `activeEvents`/`economy`/`foldBuild` are index-based `LOG` closures in all three (not the engine's array API), CharGen's `MUT` is specialized export-bridge logic, and DM Console's `MUT` diverges from the engine's (stale `found`, missing `dbound`). See D-GH26. Verified in-browser: all three tools boot clean, a Live Sheet buy still emits one event, DM's `dmAnalyze` replays LS-001 to total 78, `engine-parity.html` → 5/0.

Session note covering 7 new audit/checking roadmap items (Supabase advisor/log checklist step, docs-consistency audit, pre-release QA checklist, rules-correctness review note, AUD-1 version-sync follow-up, plus LATER bullets A9/A10), REV-11's promotion to NEXT, the stale D-GH14 reservation fix (corrected to D-GH18), A2's promotion to NEXT with the `/code-review` cadence folded in, and two separate collisions with concurrent sessions' work on `preview` (a rejected push absorbing 86 commits, then a further fast-forward mid-close-out).

  `.claude/*.json` and `.claude/.fpp-reminder-state` — the actual gitignored config this repo has (PACT
  has no `.env`/build-step config at all) — into every new worktree `/run-task` creates.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — add YAML frontmatter to every `.claude/commands/*.md` skill** (all six command
  files; no code/rules change). Each now declares `description`/`argument-hint`; the report-only or
  draft-only ones (`close-session`, `plan-for-review`, `cleanup-branches`, `pick-task`) also get
  `disallowed-tools` as the actual hard gate (`allowed-tools` alone only pre-approves tools, it doesn't
  block them) — Edit/Write and any push/commit/merge/destructive-git tool are explicitly disallowed on
  those four.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — split `/next-task` into `/pick-task` + `/run-task`** (`.claude/commands/next-task.md`
  deleted; `.claude/commands/pick-task.md`, `.claude/commands/run-task.md` new; no code/rules change).
  `/pick-task` fetches live state, picks a task, and pre-flights it with no editing or worktree tools
  available at all; `/run-task <slug>` does the actual work. Splits one "go" that used to authorize the
  whole fetch→pick→edit→test→rebase→push→PR pipeline into two separate invocations, with a real tool-level
  gate (not just prompt wording) preventing `/pick-task` from touching anything.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — `/run-task` adopts native Claude Code worktrees (`EnterWorktree`)** (`run-task.md`,
  `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md` D-GH22; no code/rules change). Replaces ~30 lines of manual
  `git worktree add` / `-C <path>` arithmetic (which had a doubled-path bug: `pact-worktrees/pact-worktrees/<slug>`)
  with `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree`. Worktrees now land at `.claude/worktrees/<slug>/` (added to
  `.gitignore`) instead of a sibling `pact-worktrees/` folder — supersedes the earlier "Option A" layout
  decision. Added a rebase-conflict gate in Step 6: a non-trivial conflict stops for a human look instead
  of resolving silently under the earlier "go."
- **2026-07-04 · feat — `/pick-task` Step 1 delegates to an Explore subagent** (`pick-task.md`,
  `DECISIONS.md` D-GH23; no code/rules change). The four `git show` fetches (`AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`, `engine-parity.html`, `expected-results.csv`) are now delegated to an
  `Explore`-type subagent that returns only the derived facts, keeping the raw file content out of the
  picking session's own context — mirrors the pattern `/log-ai-lessons` already uses for glob input.
- **2026-07-04 · fix — remove `/add-roadmap-task`'s "test mode"** (`.claude/commands/add-roadmap-task.md`;
  no code/rules change). Never used, and its bare-word "test" trigger could misfire on a legitimate task
  like "add a task to write more engine tests," causing an unwanted second commit to `preview`.
- **2026-07-04 · fix — `/close-session` skips the test-gate check on docs-only sessions**
  (`.claude/commands/close-session.md`; no code/rules change). A session that only touched `docs/`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, or `PACT_ROADMAP.md` now gets "test gate — skipped, docs-only" instead
  of a false "can't confirm tests ran" flag. Also fixed a leftover bare `gh pr list` invocation in item 6
  to reference the GitHub MCP read tools instead.
- **2026-07-04 · fix — `/log-ai-lessons` Step 4 discloses the push-to-`main` consequence**
  (`.claude/commands/log-ai-lessons.md`; no code/rules change). The approval prompt said "Write C1 and
  C3?" without stating that approval commits and pushes to `main` on the external `ai-lessons-learned`
  repo — same class of hidden-consequence bug already fixed elsewhere in `/add-roadmap-task`.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — add `/cleanup-branches` skill** (`.claude/commands/cleanup-branches.md`; new file,
  no code/rules change). Does what `/close-session` item 6 identifies but refuses to act on: scans for
  merged/orphaned branches and worktrees, presents lettered cleanup candidates, and deletes only the ones
  explicitly approved (`-d` before escalating to `-D`). No push/edit/remote-write tools granted.
- **2026-07-03 · fix — resolve duplicate `D-GH19` reservation in `DECISIONS.md`** (`DECISIONS.md`, `.claude/commands/log-ai-lessons.md`; no code/rules change). Two independent sessions' merges landed the same day and both claimed `D-GH19` for unrelated decisions (`ai-lessons-learned` auto-load nudge vs. this session's Live Sheet mobile CSS cascade fix), with no separator between them — a clean auto-merge on both sides masked the collision until this was next read. Renumbered the `ai-lessons-learned` entry (chronologically later, already sorted at the top) to `D-GH20`, added the missing `---` separator, and fixed the one stale cross-reference in `.claude/commands/log-ai-lessons.md`. No other stale `D-GH19` references found.
- **2026-07-03 · chore — `/close-session`: loosen the session-note trigger from "spanned multiple areas" to "anything not fully captured by a one-line CHANGELOG entry"** (`.claude/commands/close-session.md`; no code/rules change). The prior bar ("real discussion or spanned multiple areas") would have let this same session skip its own note right up until the CSS cascade-order bug was found — scope, not surprise, isn't actually what makes a session worth narrating. New criteria: a root cause that differed from the task's diagnosis, a judgment call between valid approaches, a plan that changed mid-session, a collision with another session's work, or two-plus roadmap items done together. Explicitly not about task complexity or tool-call count.
- **2026-07-04 · docs(sessions) — record the `/plan-for-review` build, dogfood test, and rebase-time D-GH collision** (`docs/sessions/2026-07-04-plan-for-review-skill.md`; no code/rules change). Session note covering the skill's design, the 3-review dogfood pass and what it changed, and the D-GH20→D-GH21 collision caught mid-rebase (same failure mode as 2026-07-03's D-GH19 collision, this time before merge).
- **2026-07-04 · fix — rebase `D-GH20` → `D-GH21` collision before merge, not after** (`DECISIONS.md`; no code/rules change). This branch's own D-GH20 entry (see below) was drafted against a `main` that still had the old duplicate-`D-GH19` numbering; a same-day sibling session fixed that duplicate by renumbering it to D-GH20 and merged first. Rebasing this branch onto the updated `main` silently concatenated both entries under one `## D-GH20` heading with no conflict (git saw no overlapping lines) — the exact same collision mechanism as the 2026-07-03 `D-GH19` incident, just a rebase away from landing a third time. Caught during `/close-session`'s preview/main-sync check before this branch was pushed; renumbered this branch's entry to D-GH21 here instead of after another merge.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — `/plan-for-review`: add Step 7, handling returned review feedback** (`.claude/commands/plan-for-review.md`; no code/rules change). The skill previously ended at handoff with no guidance for when the user comes back with a reviewer's response. Added a step that: treats the response format as unconstrained (prose, bullets, a structured report — read for content, not shape); explicitly asks "anything else to add?" before triaging, since there may be more than one response (multiple reviewers/tools) arriving across separate turns; and triages rather than blindly applying — low-risk findings clearly consistent with repo conventions get applied directly, while anything touching security/secrets, contradicting a `DECISIONS.md` entry, showing reviewer disagreement, or genuinely uncertain gets surfaced to the user by name instead of auto-applied. Mirrors the manual triage just done on the skill's own first cross-AI review (3 independent responses, applied the consensus fixes, called out what was skipped and why).
- **2026-07-04 · fix — `/plan-for-review`: apply cross-AI review findings (workflow, filenames, scope, secrets)** (`.claude/commands/plan-for-review.md`; `DECISIONS.md` D-GH21; no code/rules change). Dogfooded the skill on itself — its own first output (a plan for adding `/plan-for-review`) was sent through three independent cold AI reviews, which converged on the same gaps. Fixed the triple/double-flagged ones: restated the workflow as explicit stages (draft → approval → write → optional commit → optional push) and stopped the template's "Done when" from folding in commit/push status; defined the `docs/plans/<date>-<slug>.md` filename algorithm (slug derivation, collision handling via `-2`/`-3`); added a step to check for and link a prior plan on the same topic (`Supersedes:` line); added an "Out of scope" template section; swapped "line numbers" for "files/functions/symbols" (durable references); let Reviewer instructions explicitly invite structural/redesign suggestions, not just gap-finding; and added an explicit never-inline-secrets instruction, since this doc is designed to leave the repo's trust boundary (see D-GH21).
- **2026-07-04 · fix — `/plan-for-review`: make Context inline-quoted, not file-referenced** (`.claude/commands/plan-for-review.md`; no code/rules change). The doc this skill produces is normally pasted into a *different* AI tool with no access to this repo — the original Context section said to "pull from AGENTS.md/DECISIONS.md," which a reviewer with no filesystem can't act on. Added an explicit assume-no-repo-access instruction: any rule/constraint/prior decision must be quoted or paraphrased inline, and the proposed approach should name concrete files/functions/line numbers where already known.
- **2026-07-04 · feat — add `/plan-for-review` skill: draft a plan as a self-contained file for cross-AI review** (`.claude/commands/plan-for-review.md`; new file, no code/rules change). Turns a task/idea into a written plan (goal, context, proposed approach, alternatives considered, risks/open questions, done-when) plus an explicit "Reviewer instructions" block, so a *different* AI session/model (or a person) can pick it up cold — no shared conversation context — and critique it without implementing anything. Follows the same draft-then-approve convention as `/log-ai-lessons`/`/add-roadmap-task`: shows the drafted content for approval before writing, then saves to `docs/plans/<date>-<slug>.md` and asks separately whether to commit it, since a handoff artifact for pasting into another AI tool doesn't always need to land in the repo.
- **2026-07-03 · feat — add `/log-ai-lessons` skill: mine a session/file for cross-project lessons** (`.claude/commands/log-ai-lessons.md`; new file, no code/rules change). The original `ai-lessons-learned` design named a `log-lesson` skill but it was never actually built — only `/close-session`'s item 9 existed, and that only looks at the current session as it's closing. This is the reusable, standalone version (named `/log-ai-lessons` to read more clearly against the repo's own name): point it at a file (an exported/teleported transcript, a `docs/sessions/*.md` entry, a `DECISIONS.md` excerpt) or a glob of many, or call it with no argument to mine the current conversation. For a directory/glob of several files it delegates the actual reading to a `general-purpose` agent so the bulk of the source content never enters the calling session's own context — only the drafted candidates come back. Follows the same report-then-approve convention as `/close-session`'s existing cross-project-hints check: drafts candidates in the `templates/log-lesson-snippet.md` shape, lists them for approval, and only writes/commits/pushes to `inbox/` on approved ones — never guesses an `H-###` id, since `scripts/curate.mjs` assigns the real one at curation time. Doubles as the mechanism for the still-open historical-backfill roadmap item (mining `docs/sessions/*.md` + `DECISIONS.md`) rather than a one-off delegated agent call.
- **2026-07-03 · fix — SessionStart hook: stop trying to auto-clone `ai-lessons-learned`, nudge the agent instead** (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`; no engine/rules change). Follow-up to the retest below: since `add_repo` can't be called from a non-interactive shell hook, and shouldn't be called unconditionally every session anyway, the hook no longer does any `git clone`/`AI_LESSONS_TOKEN` logic. In a remote session it now just prints a short fixed-cost reminder pointing at `chompy78/ai-lessons-learned` and telling the agent to call `add_repo` + read `INDEX.md` itself if the current task looks relevant — full pull-in only happens on sessions that actually need it, and `AI_LESSONS_TOKEN` is no longer read anywhere (can be deleted from the environment config). Chose this over auto-publishing a public mirror of `INDEX.md` (verified technically viable — `raw.githubusercontent.com` isn't subject to the session's GitHub-scoping proxy) because the repo is expected to hold a lot of private session detail over time and the user wants it to stay fully private, not just mostly private. See DECISIONS.md and the session doc's "Redesign decision" section.
- **2026-07-03 · docs — retest `ai-lessons-learned` clone: root cause was session GitHub scoping, not the PAT** (`docs/sessions/2026-07-03-ai-lessons-learned-setup.md`; no code change). Re-tested the clone that failed in the prior session, with the regenerated fine-grained PAT confirmed present as `AI_LESSONS_TOKEN`. Still failed identically — because the real blocker was never the token: this session's `github.com`/`api.github.com` traffic is routed through a policy-enforcing proxy that injects the session's own scoped GitHub App credentials, overriding any PAT in the URL/header, and rejects repos outside the session's explicit scope as "not found." Confirmed by probing `api.github.com` directly (valid 200 for `/user`, proxy-authored 403 for the repo) and by using `add_repo` (an agent tool, not shell) to grant scope, after which a plain unauthenticated clone succeeded immediately. This means `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`'s raw-PAT approach can never work in a remote session regardless of configuration — flagged as a design gap to resolve in a follow-up, not fixed in this change. See the session doc's "Retest result" section for full detail.
- **2026-07-03 · feat — SessionStart hook loads cross-project `ai-lessons-learned` notes in remote sessions** (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, `.claude/settings.json`; new files, no engine/rules change). Part of a new, separate `ai-lessons-learned` repo for durable, cross-project AI-coding lessons that shouldn't live inside PACT specifically (design/status in `docs/sessions/2026-07-03-ai-lessons-learned-setup.md`). On a persistent local machine, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` can `@`-import that repo's `INDEX.md` directly, but remote/cloud sessions have no persistent home directory for that to work — this hook covers that case instead: only when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` and an `AI_LESSONS_TOKEN` env var is present, it clones/pulls `ai-lessons-learned` and prints `INDEX.md` to stdout (surfaced by Claude Code as session context); fails silently on any error so a broken/missing token never blocks a session from starting. `.claude/settings.json` was force-added despite `.claude/*.json` being gitignored, since it currently holds only this hook registration — worth re-checking if local approvals start accumulating in that file later. End-to-end clone still failing as of this session (token/permission issue under investigation); hook's no-token and non-remote fallback paths verified working.
- **2026-07-03 · feat — `/close-session`: add cross-project hints check** (`.claude/commands/close-session.md`; no code/rules change). New checklist item 9 prompts the session to flag any lesson general to AI-assisted coding (not PACT-specific) for capture into the new `ai-lessons-learned` repo, following the skill's existing report-only + explicit-approval pattern — never writes anything without approval.
- **2026-07-03 · fix — `/next-task`: make worktree paths OS-agnostic** (`.claude/commands/next-task.md`; no code/rules change). Steps 4/6/8 hardcoded a Windows-only worktree path (`C:\Users\JohnChow\pact-worktrees\...`), which breaks the skill outright when run from a Linux remote session. Replaced with a portable pattern: derive the worktree root from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`'s parent directory instead of a hardcoded OS-specific path.
- **2026-07-02 · chore — `/close-session`: re-check existing session notes for staleness, not just presence** (`.claude/commands/close-session.md`; no code/rules change). Caught live: the skill's docs-check step confirmed a session note existed and stopped there, without re-reading it against work that happened *after* it was written — a note covering two roadmap fixes went stale mid-session once a duplicate-PR discovery, a port, a merge-conflict resolution, and a final merge all happened afterward, and a second `/close-session` run still reported it as "done" on presence alone. Added an explicit instruction: if a note for the session already exists, re-read its content against everything that's happened since, every time this step runs.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — Live Sheet unusably cramped on small mobile screens (~375-400px)** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no `compute()`/`DATA.version` change; parity 5/0). Fixed the spell-slot grid forcing 9 columns at any width (now 5 at ≤600px, 3 at ≤400px), added a `@media(max-width:400px)` tier further narrowing `.spcols` to 1 column and `.shabrow`/`.shkpis` to 2, and added tap-to-collapse/expand on the three top-level cards (Buy/progress, Character, History & ledger) at ≤1000px, reusing the existing `.bgcat`/`.cath` ▾/▸ pattern — default state is all-open, no persistence (least new state-persistence machinery, per the roadmap task's own call). Bigger, previously-undiagnosed finding made while auditing the existing `@media(max-width:600px)` block: it sits *before* several unconditional base rules (`.abrow`, `.kpis`, `.ib`, `.cath`) in the stylesheet, so with equal CSS specificity those later base rules silently won the cascade — verified live with a headless browser (computed styles showed the un-overridden desktop values at a 375px viewport even though the mobile CSS "looked" correct). This meant the ability-score row never actually shrank from 6 to 3 columns on mobile, and the buy-button/category-header font/padding bumps never applied — the dominant cause of the reported cramping, beyond the specific gaps the roadmap task called out. Fixed with `!important` on the shadowed declarations, matching this same file's existing convention for the identical problem in its `@media print` overrides. Desktop/tablet (>1000px) layout confirmed unchanged. See DECISIONS.md D-GH19. Closes the "Live Sheet unusably cramped on small mobile screens" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — PWA stale-version bug: users never got the "new version ready" reload prompt** (`service-worker.js`, `index.html`, `login.html`, `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `tools/DM-Console.html`; display/infrastructure-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; parity unaffected). Three compounding causes, all fixed: (1) the service worker's network-first `fetch(e.request)` for `*.html`/`js/engine.js` had no cache-control override, so it could silently return a stale browser-cached response despite being "network-first" as a strategy — added `{cache:'no-store'}`. (2) No page proactively called `registration.update()`, leaving update checks to the browser's own (hours-to-24h) periodic timer — added `reg.update()` immediately on registration, plus again on `visibilitychange`(→visible) and `focus`, in all 5 pages' SW registration blocks (the immediate call was ported over from a duplicate fix in PR #97, opened independently in a parallel session for the same roadmap item — closed as superseded once this PR had everything from both). (3) `login.html`'s `updatefound` handler silently force-reloaded the instant a new SW installed, unlike the other four pages' dismissible banner-and-click-to-reload pattern — aligned it to the same banner. The "robust fallback layer" (an independent version-marker poll) from the roadmap task's diagnosis was deliberately deferred — it depends on the not-yet-landed `BUILD` export task and the task note explicitly said not to block on it. Verified via a headless browser: `service-worker.js`'s fetch now correctly bypasses the HTTP cache. Closes the "PWA stale-version bug" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-02 · chore — merge `/next-task` effort and model checks into one calibration step** (`.claude/commands/next-task.md`; no code/rules change). Previously Check 2 stopped every run to confirm the session was already at High effort, and Check 3 separately asked about switching to Opus — two potential interruptions even for the routine case. Merged into a single Check 2 that assumes High reasoning effort and Sonnet by default with no confirmation needed, and only asks once (covering both effort and model together) when the picked task actually warrants escalating to `xhigh`/`max` and/or Opus.

- **2026-07-02 · fix — Live Sheet: Magically/Martially Bound showed a contradictory "-2" cost badge** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; parity unaffected). Found during a post-hoc audit of the day's merged work: Feature A's `priceOf()` correctly returns `-2` for `mbound`/`dbound` (a negative "cost" is this codebase's existing convention for an AP-granting purchase, matching how drawbacks are priced), but `ib()`'s `costlbl` and `unaff` (afford-gate) logic only special-cased `cat==='drawback'`, not the two new categories. Net effect: the "Martially Bound"/"Magically Bound" buttons showed a literal "-2" badge right next to label text that already said "(+2 AP)" (self-contradictory), and — in the edge case of an already over-budget character (`eco.available` more negative than -2) — could be incorrectly hard-blocked as unaffordable with a nonsensical "needs -2 AP" message, even though the purchase only ever helps the budget. Extended both checks to include `mbound`/`dbound` alongside `drawback`, matching the existing convention exactly. No change to `compute()`/pricing math, which was already correct (verified: `d.bound` correctly drives both the `mbGain` AP credit and the per-level spell-cost discount in `js/engine.js`).
- **2026-07-02 · fix — apply REV-07 CSPRNG invite-code migration + pin missing function `search_path`s (live Supabase)** (`sql/migrations/2026-07-02-rev07-csprng-invite-codes.sql` execution only, no new repo file; DB-only, no engine/logic change; parity unaffected). Follow-up to the day's audit: the REV-07 migration file had been committed and merged but never actually applied to the live project — confirmed live via `pg_proc.prosrc`, `gen_invite_code()` was still on `random()`. Applied it live via the Supabase MCP; confirmed the deployed function now uses `gen_random_bytes()` and a sample code matches `^[A-Z0-9]{6}$`. Also found (Supabase security advisor) that `gen_invite_code` and `set_updated_at` were the only two functions in the schema missing a pinned `search_path`, unlike every other function — pinned both to `search_path=public` via `ALTER FUNCTION`, closing a schema-shadowing hardening gap. Closes the "Verify REV-07 invite-code migration live in Supabase" roadmap item. See DECISIONS.md D-GH17.
- **2026-07-02 · docs — fix AGENTS.md's stale "module bridge" claim** (`AGENTS.md`; no code change, parity unaffected). AGENTS.md's Architecture section claimed all three tools load `DATA`/`compute`/`MUT`/`baseBuild`/etc. from `js/engine.js` via a module bridge, with only CharGen still embedding its own copy — false on the live code. Verified directly: all three tools (CharGen, Live Sheet, DM Console) hand-copy `DATA`/`compute`/`MUT`/`baseBuild` and none import them from `js/engine.js`. What's actually bridged differs per tool and is narrower than claimed: Live Sheet's `<script type="module">` imports only `validate()` from the engine plus sync/auth/campaign helpers, firing `sync-ready`; DM Console's module script imports auth/campaign/dm helpers only — nothing from `js/engine.js`, not even `validate()` — firing `campaign-ready`; CharGen has no module bridge at all. Corrected the Architecture bullet to describe this accurately so a future agent can't ship an engine-only edit that silently no-ops in a tool while `engine-parity.html` stays green. See DECISIONS.md D-GH9.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — CharGen "⇆ Live Sheet" export crash on any species/racial trait** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; display/integration-only, no `compute()` output change, `DATA.version` untouched; parity 5/0). `buildToLiveLog()`'s local `liveBase()` — CharGen's own hand-copied duplicate of `js/engine.js`'s `baseBuild()` shape — was missing `racialTraits:[]`; the local MUT's unguarded `racial:(b,p)=>b.racialTraits.push(p.v)` threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')` on export for any character with ≥1 species/racial trait, silently discarding the export (caught by `exportToLiveSheet()`'s own try/catch, so only a flash error + console.error, no raw crash — but nothing saved). Added `racialTraits:[]` to `liveBase()`. Ran the full sweep the roadmap task called for: diffed `liveBase()`'s field list against `baseBuild()`'s (found `languageNames`/`grantNames`/`dabblerCantripNames`/`innateNames`/`featNames`/`size`/`inPlay` also missing) and audited every other `.push()` in the local MUT for the same unguarded-missing-field pattern — no other gap found; every other push target is already initialized in `liveBase()`, and every read of the still-missing name/size fields elsewhere in the file is defensively `||[]`/`||{}`-guarded. `inPlay` specifically was NOT added — it drives racial-trait tier pricing and must stay unset (creation-basis) for a freshly-exported character; see DECISIONS.md D-GH18 for why. Verified in-browser (Playwright): selecting Elf + a racial trait and calling `buildToLiveLog()` threw pre-fix, succeeded post-fix with the trait present in the exported log; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` still 5/0. Closes the "Fix crash exporting to Live Sheet when a species/racial trait is selected" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-02 · feat — Feature A: Live Sheet multi-tradition / multi-discipline spellcasting + Magically Bound** (`js/engine.js`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; `compute()`/`DATA.version` untouched — both engine copies already priced multi-discipline and `d.bound` correctly, only the mutation layer was missing; parity 5/0). Players can now found more than one tradition and buy more than one discipline per tradition, each shown on its own row in the buy panel and the spell panel. Extended the `found` MUT to add a discipline to an already-open tradition (instead of only founding a fresh one) and added a `dbound` setter, in **both** `js/engine.js` and Live Sheet's own hand-copied MUT (see D-GH9 — Live Sheet does not actually consume `js/engine.js`'s MUT/compute/DATA via a bridge, despite `AGENTS.md`'s architecture section claiming otherwise). Per-discipline "Magically Bound": a one-way (undo-only) toggle that grants a flat +2 AP and applies a −1 spell discount (cantrips/slots/known, floor 1) to that discipline from then on; `priceOf` now special-cases `mbound`/`dbound` to a flat ±2 AP instead of a full recompute diff, which also fixes a pre-existing bug where taking Martially Bound retroactively discounted already-owned features of that class. "Subclass spell lists" moved from the "Class & subclass" bucket to "Magic" in `_catOf`. The "Add discipline" / "Open another tradition" buttons are hidden when the active campaign's `multiDisciplineAllowed` rule is `false` (reusing `window._cloudCampaignRules`, no new fetch), closing the multi-discipline gap D-GH16 flagged as pending. `ib()`'s tooltip now includes the `descr` text, not just the warning/reason. Verified in-browser: open a tradition, add a 2nd discipline to it, open a 2nd tradition, buy Magically Bound (flat +2, only future purchases on that discipline discount), and confirm the add-discipline/open-tradition buttons disappear under a `multiDisciplineAllowed:false` campaign. See DECISIONS.md D-GH9. Closes Feature A.
- **2026-07-02 · chore — ignore the `/close-session` reminder-hook state file** (`.gitignore`; no code change). `.claude/.fpp-reminder-state` (backoff-schedule state for the permission-allowlist reminder hook) wasn't covered by the existing `.claude/*.json` pattern since it has no extension — added an explicit `.claude/.fpp-reminder-state` line so it can't accidentally get committed.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — REV-07: source invite codes from a CSPRNG** (`sql/schema.sql`, `sql/migrations/2026-07-02-rev07-csprng-invite-codes.sql`; no engine/logic change; parity unaffected). `gen_invite_code()` built each of its 6 characters via `floor(random()*36)` — Postgres's non-cryptographic PRNG — even though invite codes function as shared secrets gating `join_campaign`/`join_as_dm`. Now pulls 6 bytes from pgcrypto's `gen_random_bytes()` (already enabled) and reduces each mod 36 onto the same `A-Z0-9` alphabet; code length and the `^[A-Z0-9]{6}$` check regex are unchanged. Code length and `join_campaign` rate-limiting were also suggested by the review but left as separate, lower-priority follow-ups — see D-GH17. Closes REV-07.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — drop legacy `award_xp`, lock down anon EXECUTE on `award_ap`** (`sql/migrations/2026-07-02-drop-legacy-award-xp-lock-award-ap.sql`, `sql/rls-policies.sql`; no engine/logic change; parity unaffected). Supabase's security advisor flagged both `award_xp` and `award_ap` as callable by the unauthenticated `anon` role via `/rest/v1/rpc/*`. `award_xp` was dead code left over from the XP → AP rename — zero references remained in `js/` or `sql/` — dropped outright. `award_ap` is live and was already internally guarded (`is_campaign_dm()` rejects any caller without a real `auth.uid()` match, so `anon` could never actually award anything), but had never had its default Postgres EXECUTE-to-`PUBLIC` grant revoked. Grant now matches intent (`authenticated`-only) instead of relying solely on the internal check. Verified live via `has_function_privilege('anon', ..., 'EXECUTE')` before/after. See D-GH15.
- **2026-07-02 · feat — DM campaign rules: live-filter banned masteries/boons in Live Sheet** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; `js/engine.js` diff is empty — parity unaffected). Follow-up to the DM campaign rules feature: previously a rule violation was only caught at "Save to cloud," forcing players to undo work built around a banned choice. Added `cloudRuleBarred()` and filtered it into the weapon-mastery and boon pickers (mirroring the existing `campBarred()` pattern for the older local rules code) so a banned-but-not-yet-purchased item never appears to select; already-owned items stay visible so they remain manageable. Campaign rules are now fetched on sign-in/session-ready (`refreshCloudCampaignRules()`), not just at the cloud-save click, so filtering is live from page load. Species/origin-class/multi-discipline bans still can't be live-filtered — Live Sheet has no picker for them at all (they're fixed at creation or not yet buildable) — so those remain enforced only at cloud push; closing that gap needs CharGen campaign-rule awareness, filed as a new roadmap item. See DECISIONS.md D-GH16.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — lower Live Sheet low-spend nudge threshold to 50 AP** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; `js/engine.js` diff is empty — parity unaffected). The CharGen nudge banner added in PR #74 fired below 70 AP spent; changed the `_apNudgeBanner` cutoff to 50 AP per user request. No other behaviour change.
- **2026-07-02 · feat — Live Sheet low-spend nudge toward CharGen** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; `js/engine.js` diff is empty — parity unaffected). Added a dismissible sticky banner (`_apNudgeBanner`, keyed off `economy(idx).spent`) shown in `render()` whenever the active character has spent under 70 AP, explaining that Live Sheet skips CharGen's character-creation discounts (race/origin bonuses) and pointing players to CharGen as the recommended starting point. Dismissal is remembered per-character (`window._apNudgeDismissedFor`, matched against `currentCharId()`) so importing or cloud-loading a different character shows it again automatically; `resetAll()` explicitly clears the flag so a freshly wiped character sees it too. Verified in-browser: banner shows at 0 AP spent, dismiss button hides it and survives a re-render, hides automatically once spend reaches 70+, and reappears after Reset. Closes the "Live Sheet low-spend warning" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — CU-7: surface Save/Load/Live Sheet actions on mobile CharGen** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; parity 5/0). Desktop's character-action buttons (Save, Load, Sheet, Live Sheet, AI Portrait, Share, Name spells, Campaign, Info) live in the sticky header's `.hd-row3`, which is hidden below the 768px breakpoint in favour of `.hd-mobnav` (Random/Reset/section-jump only) — mobile players had no way to save, load, or export to the Live Sheet. Added a non-sticky `.mobile-action-bar` row, rendered outside the sticky header (between it and `.layout`) and shown only at the existing mobile breakpoint, reusing the same `onclick` handlers as the desktop buttons; Random/Reset stay in `.hd-mobnav` (already reachable) and the `#campind` indicator span was left off the mobile bar to avoid a duplicate-id conflict with its desktop copy. Desktop layout unchanged. Closes CU-7.
- **2026-07-02 · chore — clarify `/next-task` effort and model checks** (`.claude/commands/next-task.md`; no code/rules change). Check 2 now explains *why* "High" effort is the default floor (redo cost of a broken rebase or failed test suite in this shared-repo workflow) instead of just naming a threshold, and says not to reach for `xhigh`/`max` by default. Added Check 3: default to Sonnet, only recommend switching to Opus when the picked task has real rework risk (engine rules logic, data-model/migration decisions, cross-tool contracts) — not just because it "sounds important".
- **2026-07-02 · feat — DM campaign rules: configure and enforce on cloud push** (`js/engine.js`, `js/campaign.js`, `sql/schema.sql`, `sql/migrations/2026-07-02-campaign-rules.sql`, `tools/DM-Console.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; new `campaigns.rules` jsonb column, no RLS change needed — existing `campaigns_update` row policy already restricts writes to DMs; `js/engine.js` gains a new `validate(build, campaignRules)` export, `compute()` untouched, `DATA.version` unchanged). DMs can now set banned species/origin-species/origin-classes/weapon-masteries/boons, a multi-discipline-allowed toggle, and freeform house-rule toggles per campaign from a new "Campaign Rules" panel in DM Console; players can see but not edit them. Live Sheet's "☁ Save to cloud" now fetches the character's campaign rules and calls `validate()` before pushing — a rule-violating build is blocked with a clear per-rule error and never reaches Supabase. Local/offline autosave and solo (non-campaign) play are unaffected. Parity 5/0. See DECISIONS.md D-GH14. Closes the "DM campaign rules" roadmap item.
- **2026-07-01 · chore — add `/close-session` command** (`.claude/commands/close-session.md`; no code/rules change). Report-only checklist for wrapping up a session: docs (CHANGELOG/DECISIONS/sessions), roadmap graduation, test gate, working-tree state, this session's worktree, a repo-wide branch/worktree sweep, preview/main sync status, and open PRs — surfaces further actions as a flat `A1`/`A2`/... list for a single yes/no reply instead of one-at-a-time prompts. Promoted preview → main in the same session (PR #69).
- **2026-07-01 · chore — simplify `/next-task` command wording** (`.claude/commands/next-task.md`; no code/rules change). Reworded all 8 steps in plainer, less jargon-heavy language for readability; the effort-gate hard stop (Step 3) and every other rule kept as-is. Promoted preview → main in the same session (PR #64).
- **2026-07-01 · fix — standardise CharGen toolbar spacing** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`; display-only, no engine/`DATA.version` change; parity 5/0). The `#campind` campaign-indicator span carried an inline `margin-left:6px` on top of the toolbar's own `gap:8px` flex spacing, widening the visible gap between the Campaign and Live Sheet buttons versus every other adjacent button pair. Removed the inline margin so spacing is controlled solely by the shared toolbar `gap`.

- **2026-07-01 · fix — REV-06: offline delete no longer resurrects on reconnect** (`js/sync.js`; no engine/logic change; parity 5/0). `deleteCharacter` previously ran `lsRemove` even when offline (server delete only attempted if online), so the local copy vanished but the server row survived — the next `syncAll`/`listCharacters` pull brought the "deleted" character back. Added a `pact-deletes` tombstone list: `deleteCharacter` now always removes local + records the id as pending, and attempts the server delete immediately if online. `syncAll`/`reconcile` replay any pending deletes first (and exclude tombstoned ids from the reconcile pass so a same-round pull can't resurrect them before the delete lands); `listCharacters` filters tombstoned ids out of both the online and offline result sets. A tombstone clears only once the server delete actually succeeds. Closes REV-06.
- **2026-07-01 · fix — REV-05: sync compares parsed instants, not raw timestamp strings** (`js/sync.js`; no engine/compute change; parity 5/0). `reconcile()`'s last-write-wins check did `local.updated_at > server.updated_at` as a plain string comparison — this breaks when one side's ISO timestamp uses `Z` and the other `+00:00`, or when sub-second precision differs, causing a false "local is newer" (or vice versa) and a lost update. Extracted the comparison into an exported `isNewerInstant(a, b)` helper (`Date.parse(a) > Date.parse(b)`) and added `testing/tests/sync-timestamp.html`, a browser-run regression test covering mixed `Z`/`+00:00` formats and differing sub-second precision (5/5 passing). Closes REV-05.

- **2026-07-01 · chore — CU-4: prune merged branches** — verified `data/tools-v0.332`, `engine/data-v0.332`, `feature/dual-source-ap`, `feature/live-sheet-dual-ap`, `fix/engine-v0.332-data`, `task1/pwa-shell`, `task2/auth`, `task3/sql-data-model`, `feature/campaign-play`, `feature/homepage-index`, and `task2/auth-gate` no longer exist locally or on origin (already cleaned up in an earlier session); `git branch -a` now shows only `main`, `preview`, and active in-flight branches. No code change.

- **2026-07-01 · chore — CU-6: rename `DM Console.html` → `DM-Console.html`** (`tools/DM Console.html` → `tools/DM-Console.html`; `index.html` card link, `service-worker.js` PRE_CACHE entry, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` updated to match). No engine/logic change; parity unaffected — verified 5/0 and console loads at the new path with the SW precache URL updated.
- **2026-07-01 · fix — CharGen → Live Sheet export silently failed to save on blocked storage** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; display/integration-only, no engine/compute change; parity 5/0). Root cause: Live Sheet's `save()`/`load()` swallowed `localStorage` errors in an empty `catch(e){}` — when storage was blocked (private/incognito browsing, quota, disabled storage) the import flow still showed "Loaded character." with nothing actually persisted, so the character vanished on reload. `exportToLiveSheet()` in CharGen had the same silent-failure shape (bare `onclick`, no outer `try/catch`, so a thrown error became an invisible unhandled rejection — the reported "button does nothing"). Both now `console.error` and surface a visible `flash()` warning on failure; the normal save/export path is unchanged (confirmed via engine-parity 5/0 and a manual export → import → reload round trip). Closes the CharGen → Live Sheet roadmap item.

- **2026-07-01 · docs — CU-1: single-source agent docs** (`CLAUDE.md` stub → `@AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` pointer stub, `docs/HOW-TO-WORK.md` three-copies chore removed; no code change). Closes REV-08. `git grep -l "Master copy"` returns nothing outside the roadmap task description itself.

- **2026-07-01 · chore — REV-10: stop tracking `.claude/` JSON config files** (`.gitignore`, `.claude/launch.json` untracked; no code change). Replaced blanket `.claude/` ignore with `.claude/*.json` so machine-specific config (`launch.json`, `settings*.json`) is ignored while project-specific agent + command definitions remain tracked. Closes REV-10.
- **2026-07-02 · fix — close stored-XSS gap in custom tools/instruments (CharGen + Live Sheet)** (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; no engine/logic change; parity 5/0). The character-sheet "Tools & Instruments" renderer interpolated `b.customProfs` (free text from the "+ custom tool/instrument" field) directly into an `innerHTML` string with no escaping, unlike every other player-controlled field in the same renderer. Wrapped it in the existing `_csEsc()` helper (already used two lines below for lineage spell names) in both files. Relates to the not-yet-enforced REV-12 invariant in `docs/PACT_ROADMAP.md`. `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-07-01 · chore — CU-3: tidy repo root and test files** (`index.old.html` + `.tmp-verify.mjs` deleted; `campaign-test.html` + `sync-test.html` moved to `testing/` with relative paths updated to `../js/` and `../login.html`; `testing/README.md` replaced stray repo description with a proper harness index). Closes REV-09. No engine/logic change; parity unaffected.
- **2026-07-01 · chore — CU-2: sync DM Console build version to v0.107** (`tools/DM Console.html` `TOOL_VERSION` v0.015 → v0.107; `docs/VERSION-SYNC.md` already committed). All three tools now mirror `BUILD` in `js/engine.js`; `index.html` reads it live. No engine/logic change; parity unaffected.

- **2026-06-30 · fix — REV-04: close campaign-join bypass in RLS** (`sql/rls-policies.sql`, `sql/migrations/2026-06-30-rev04-campaign-rls.sql`; no engine/logic change; parity unaffected). Removed `campaign_id` from the player column-level UPDATE grant — `join_campaign()` (SECURITY DEFINER) is now the sole writer. Also tightened the INSERT policy with `AND campaign_id IS NULL` so a player cannot insert a character pre-joined to an arbitrary campaign; `join_campaign()` bypasses RLS as a SECURITY DEFINER function and is unaffected. `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-06-30 · fix — REV-03: service worker now uses network-first for `*.html` + `js/engine.js`** (`service-worker.js`; no engine/logic change; parity 5/0). Added `NETWORK_FIRST_RE` regex; HTML pages and `engine.js` now try the network first and fall back to cache only when offline — so a deployed rules fix reaches returning users on the very next page load without clearing storage. Icons and supporting JS files remain cache-first. `DATA.version` unchanged. (D-GH11)

- **2026-06-29 · feature — auth bar on menu: optional sign-in, no redirect gate** (`index.html`; no engine change; parity unaffected). Added a small `<script type="module">` auth block that imports `js/auth.js` and shows a "Sign in" button when signed out or "Signed in as X · Log out" when signed in. Every page (menu + tools) is open to everyone — no redirect gate. Cloud save/sync activates only when a session exists.

- **2026-06-30 · fix — REV-02: service worker now skips caching for cross-origin requests** (`service-worker.js`; no engine/logic change; parity 5/0). Added an origin guard (`url.origin !== self.location.origin → return`) to the fetch handler so Supabase API calls, esm.sh CDN responses, and any other cross-origin GETs are never intercepted or cached. Previously the handler claimed same-origin filtering in a comment but had no actual check, causing stale API responses and potential cross-user data to accumulate in Cache Storage. `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-06-30 · fix — REV-01: regression gate now asserts real values** (`testing/tests/engine-parity.html`, `testing/expected/expected-results.csv`; no engine/logic change). Rewrote the parity runner so each test compares `compute()` / `rebuildStateFromEvents()` output against a confirmed baseline in `expected-results.csv` — previously `pass` was hard-coded `true` and all CSV columns were blank. Added two modes: "Capture baseline" (dumps CSV rows from live engine output for human review) and "Run tests (assert)" (fetches the CSV and fails if any actual differs from expected). CG-003 additionally asserts `remaining < 0` and that the first warning starts with "OVER BUDGET". LS-001/EV-001 assert `.ok`, `.total`, and `.eventsApplied`. Baseline captured and confirmed at engine v0.332: CG-001 (2 AP / 0 warn), CG-002 (50 AP / 0 warn), CG-003 (67 AP / 1 warn / over by 17), LS-001 (78 AP / 1 warn / 28 events), EV-001 (68 AP / 0 warn / 7 events). Gate now reports a real FAILED test when engine output changes. `DATA.version` unchanged.
- **2026-06-30 · docs — CU-5: fix duplicate D-GH7 in DECISIONS.md** (`DECISIONS.md`, `docs/sessions/2026-06-29-header-redesign-mobile-pin-pwa-task1.md`; no code change; parity unaffected). Renamed the older "PWA SW registration" entry from `D-GH7` to `D-GH8`; updated the two session-file backreferences. The campaign-play entry (`D-GH7 · Campaign play: dual-source AP…`) and all its callers (`js/campaign.js`, `sql/schema.sql`, migration, `CHANGELOG.md`) remain unchanged. Every `D-GH#` is now unique.

- **2026-06-30 · fix — Task 5 hardening: SW pre-cache, offline login, update flow, maskable icon, preconnect** (`service-worker.js`, `login.html`, `manifest.json`, `index.html`; no engine/logic change; parity 5/0). Added `login.html` + five JS modules (`auth`, `sync`, `campaign`, `dm`, `supabase-client`) to `PRE_CACHE` so tool pages work offline from a cold install; bumped `CACHE_NAME` to `pact-v2`. Removed unconditional `self.skipWaiting()` from the SW install handler so the update-notification UI (already wired in `index.html`) can fire correctly — SW now only skips waiting when the client posts the message. Added SW registration + update handler to `login.html` (was the one page missing it — hard FAIL in audit). Added `"purpose":"maskable"` to the 512-px manifest icon (Android adaptive-icon fix). Added `<link rel="preconnect">` for `esm.sh` and the Supabase origin in `index.html`. `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-06-30 · feature — dual-source AP budget: `compute(b, opts)` and `rebuildStateFromEvents(base, events, opts)` now accept `{ dmAp, ignorePlayerAp }`** (`js/engine.js`; engine-parity **5/0**). When `dmAp` is provided it is added to the player-log AP (or replaces it when `ignorePlayerAp: true`). Returns `budget` (spendable total), `playerAp`, `dmAp`, and `spendable`; `remaining` and `status` reflect the adjusted budget. Fully backward-compatible — callers with no opts see identical output. `DATA.version` unchanged.
- **2026-06-30 · feature — Live Sheet dual-source AP: cloud-loaded characters now blend DM-granted AP into the budget** (`tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`, `js/sync.js`; no engine/DATA change; parity 5/0). When a character is loaded from the ☁ Cloud menu, `rec.ap` (DM-granted, server-authoritative) is stored as `window._dmAp`; if the character belongs to a campaign with `ignore_player_ap: true`, only DM AP counts toward the spendable budget. `render()` and `refreshBuy()` now adjust `b.budget = (ignorePlayerAp ? 0 : eco.earned) + dmAp` before calling `compute()`, so `r.remaining` (AP left), the buy-panel affordability checks, and the "OVER BUDGET" warning all reflect the correct figure. The ecoline bar gains a `· X from DM` chip when dmAp > 0 (with an "Y player AP ignored" prefix when the campaign flag is set). `sync.js` reconcile and listCharacters selects now include `campaign_id` so the load handler can look up `ignore_player_ap` via `listMyCampaigns()`. `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-06-30 · feature — Task 4 UI: campaign roster + cloud save in DM Console and Live Sheet** (`tools/DM Console.html`, `tools/PACT-Live-Char-Sheet.html`; no engine/logic change). **DM Console**: added module bridge importing `auth.js`/`campaign.js`/`dm.js`; new "Campaign (cloud)" panel in the bottom toolbar (auth status, campaign selector, player/DM invite codes with copy, ignore-player-AP toggle); new "Campaign Roster" section above the card grid (live roster from Supabase with DM-AP column, per-character Award AP form with note, 📒 history modal showing amount/DM/note/date). **Live Sheet**: added module bridge importing `auth.js`/`sync.js` + `initSync()`; new ☁ Cloud button in the top bar (next to Sheet) — dropdown shows auth status, Save to cloud (saves `{LOG,SEQ,rules}` blob via `saveCharacter()`), and a list of the user's saved livesheet characters to load from cloud (sets `LOG`/`SEQ`/`loadedRules` globals and calls `save()`+`render()`). `DATA.version` unchanged.

- **2026-06-30 · feature — landing page redesign to match the Player's Guide** (engine untouched — parity unaffected; `index.html`, `docs/PACT-Players-Guide.html`, new `pact-cover.jpg`). Rebuilt `index.html` in the guide's parchment "tome" style on shared CSS tokens (`--ink/--accent/--rule/--head`). Added a subtle theme picker (Parchment/Midnight/Dragonfire/High contrast) with an **"Auto · match device"** default that follows `prefers-color-scheme` and persists to one `localStorage` key (`pact-theme`); added link-preview metadata (Open Graph/Twitter, image → absolute Pages URL `https://chompy78.github.io/PACT/pact-cover.jpg`), an inline SVG favicon, `theme-color`, focus-visible + reduced-motion a11y (AA contrast verified), wayfinding ("Start here", For-players/For-DMs grouping with icons), a PWA install button (`beforeinstallprompt`), and an offline badge. Removed the dev-only Engine Parity Tests card and the `js/engine.js` masthead jargon. **Externalized the cover image** to a shared `pact-cover.jpg`: landing page references `pact-cover.jpg`, the guide now references `../pact-cover.jpg` (index ~420 KB → ~23 KB; guide ~1.06 MB → ~656 KB). No tool pages, engine, or save data changed; all links/wiring preserved 1:1. Verified in-browser: cover loads, 3 cards + hero render, theme switch + Auto-revert work, zero console errors. `DATA.version` unchanged.
- **2026-06-29 · data — tools refreshed to the corrected v0.332 DATA** (`tools/*.html`; no engine/logic change). Replaced each tool's embedded `const DATA={…}` block with the audited v0.332 dataset (now md5-identical across CharGen / Live Sheet / DM Console **and** `engine.js`). CharGen's static version labels (title + header) bumped v0.322→v0.332; Live Sheet & DM Console already render `DATA.version` dynamically. Browser-verified all three: load with no console errors, `compute()` prices on the new ladders (1st Expertise **5 AP**, 20 Focus **110 AP**), Barbarian "Path of the World Tree", Dragonborn "Draconic flight" sticker 9; 318 features / 33 invocations; pages display v0.332. (Tools still embed their own DATA+compute — Option B import refactor remains a later task.) `DATA.version` **v0.332**.

- **2026-06-29 · fix — correct the v0.332 engine DATA (PR #23 shipped an incomplete build)** (`js/engine.js`; engine-parity **5/0**). PR #23 merged the divergent `Downloads` export: only **106 of 318** `features`, **0 of 33** Eldritch Invocations, and missing the Dragonborn "Draconic flight" reprice (handoff change #4). Replaced `DATA` with the audited **handoff v0.332** dataset while keeping the repo's ES-module code byte-for-byte unchanged (no `compute()`/logic change). Now: 318 features, 33 invocations, Draconic flight T4 Situational (origin 9 / cross 13), expertise N+4 ladder, Focus Gentle ladder, Barbarian "Path of the World Tree". Verified against the handoff's 6-point checklist (all PASS) and DATA byte-identical to the handoff build. `DATA.version` stays **v0.332**.

- **2026-06-29 · data — engine rules data refresh, `DATA.version` v0.322 → v0.332** (`js/engine.js`). Dropped-in an externally-updated `engine.js` — **data-only**: the `DATA` object changed (new features + revised AP costs) while every function and export is byte-for-byte identical (verified via diff). Parity test still **5/0** on all fixtures at v0.332. *(Superseded — the dropped-in file was an incomplete export; corrected by the entry above.)*

- **2026-06-29 · feature — campaign-play backend: co-DMs, AP award ledger, ignore-player-AP** (`sql/schema.sql`, `sql/rls-policies.sql`, new `sql/migrations/2026-06-29-codm-ap-ledger.sql`; no engine/tool changes). New `campaign_dms` table (multiple DMs per campaign; owner auto-added; join via new `dm_invite_code`/`join_as_dm` or owner `promote_to_dm`/`remove_dm`). New `ap_awards` ledger — `award_ap(char, amount, note)` now records who/when/how much and bumps the running `characters.ap`. New `campaigns.ignore_player_ap` toggle for the dual-source AP model. `is_campaign_dm()` now checks membership; RLS + grants updated for both new tables. Run the migration on existing DBs. See `DECISIONS.md` D-GH7.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 1 complete: SW registration added to `tools/*.html`** (engine untouched — parity unaffected; `tools/*.html` only). Added the shared service-worker registration block + `<link rel="manifest" href="/PACT/manifest.json">` to all three tool pages (CharGen, Live Sheet, DM Console), using absolute `/PACT/` paths, with an in-page "new version ready / Reload" bar on `updatefound`. Finishes the SW snippet deferred from the PWA-shell entry below.

- **2026-06-29 · fix — Mobile CharGen header now stays pinned** (engine untouched; `tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`). On mobile (≤768px) the page switched to an app-shell: `body` is a flex column at `100dvh; overflow:hidden`, the header is a static `flex:0 0 auto` bar, and `.layout` becomes the scroll area (`flex:1; overflow-y:auto`). Fixes the header scrolling off on real mobile Chrome (a compositor repaint issue that `fixed`/`sticky` + GPU hints couldn't solve). Desktop keeps `position:sticky` + window scroll; "Jump to section" uses `scrollIntoView` on the inner area. See D-GH5.

- **2026-06-29 · chore — Version bump + header polish** (engine untouched; all three `tools/*.html`). CharGen & Live Sheet build → **v0.107**; DM Console `TOOL_VERSION` → **v0.015**. Header now surfaces both the Web Tool build (v0.107) and the PACT rules version (`DATA.version` v0.322, unchanged) and shows a ⚠ warning icon beside the AP total on row 1. Removed the now-unused `.topbar` CSS from CharGen. `DATA.version` unchanged. See D-GH6.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 1: PWA shell** (engine-parity 5/5; new files only). Added `manifest.json` (standalone, scope+start_url `/PACT/`), `service-worker.js` (cache-first, pre-caches all tool pages + engine, skips icon failures gracefully, "reload to update" banner), `404.html` (GitHub Pages SPA redirect), placeholder icons 192/512/180 in `icons/`. SW registration + manifest link added to `index.html`. SW snippet for `tools/*.html` deferred — prompt provided separately.

- **2026-06-29 · fix — rename XP → AP across the cloud backend** (`js/sync.js`, `js/dm.js`, harnesses; SQL + docs renamed on the data-model branch). PACT's DM-awarded currency is **AP**, not XP: `characters.xp` → `characters.ap`, `award_xp()` → `award_ap()`, and every client reference. Live DBs need the one-off `alter table … rename column xp to ap;` + function recreate.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 4 (partial): campaigns + DM AP logic** (new files `js/campaign.js`, `js/dm.js`, `campaign-test.html`; no engine/tool changes). `campaign.js`: create campaign (auto invite code), join via `join_campaign()` RPC, regenerate code (DM-only), list campaigns tagged by per-campaign role. `dm.js`: read roster (player name + character + ap), award/deduct ap via `award_ap()` RPC, read raw stats for inspection. `campaign-test.html` exercises create/join/regen/roster/award end-to-end. DM Console UI wiring deferred until tool HTML edits settle.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 3 (partial): cloud save + offline sync** (new files `js/sync.js`, `sync-test.html`; no engine/tool changes). Supabase-primary, localStorage-fallback character persistence: save/load/list/delete, last-write-wins by `updated_at`, dirty-flag retry on reconnect, `initSync()` auto-reconciles on load + the `online` event. Only raw `stats` is stored; `ap` is never pushed from local and is overwritten from the server on pull. `sync-test.html` harness verifies it end-to-end.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 2 (partial): standalone login screen** (new file `login.html`; no engine/tool changes). Self-contained sign-in / register / forgot-password page wired to `js/auth.js`, themed to match `index.html`. Lets auth be tested end-to-end before the per-page auth gate is wired in.

- **2026-06-29 · feature — Task 2 (partial): Supabase client + auth helpers** (new files `js/supabase-client.js`, `js/auth.js`; no HTML/engine changes; engine-parity unaffected). Single shared Supabase client (publishable key, RLS-protected; supabase-js loaded from CDN, no build step). Pure-logic auth module: register/login/logout, forgot + update password, current user/session, auth-change subscription, profile fetch. No global role read (roles are per-campaign, D-GH4). Login UI + HTML wiring deferred to the next step.

- **2026-06-29 · UI — CharGen: header fully redesigned with 4-row desktop layout (Row 1: name+AP+warn icon; Row 2: title+versions+timestamp; Row 3: all action buttons, wraps; Row 4: section nav) and 2-row mobile layout (Row 1: name+AP; Row 2: Random+Reset+section jump). New 768px breakpoint for header only; existing 600px breakpoint unchanged. `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Both tools: "Last edited" timestamp now reads from document.lastModified (HTTP header set by GitHub Pages from the commit date) instead of a hardcoded string. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — CharGen: AP indicator is now the sticky mini-header (#mtop): character name on left, "X / Y AP" pill on right. Removed #apFloat floating pill (not wanted in CharGen) and #chip (topbar duplicate). UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — CharGen: removed mobile bottom AP bar (#mobar); replaced with a floating pill (#apFloat, top-right) identical to the Live Sheet — shows remaining AP, flashes on change, turns red when over budget. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Live Sheet mobile improvements: header buttons become icon-only (text labels hidden), version/last-edited metadata hidden; DM toolbar scrolls horizontally; category headers get larger tap targets; bottom bar gets thumb-reachable Undo/Redo buttons alongside AP display. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Live Sheet buy panel — renamed 'Expertise' group to 'Skill expertise'. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Live Sheet buy panel — moved 'Tools & instruments' and 'Tool expertise' to sit directly after 'Expertise' (before 'Languages') in the Proficiencies group. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Live Sheet buy panel — boons and drawbacks now grouped by category (matching CharGen); boons show their effect description like drawbacks; AP moved inline next to the item name to save vertical space. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-28 · UI — Live Sheet buy panel — moved weapon masteries from the 'Languages & masteries' group into 'Weapons & armour'; renamed the languages group to 'Languages'. UI-only; `DATA.version` unchanged.**

- **2026-06-29 · fix — suppress zero-cost non-purchase entries in CharGen→Live Sheet exports** (`DATA.version`
  stayed **v0.322**; exporter-only fix). The export log now skips non-purchase setup entries like
  innate-spell defaults and character-size state, so the Live Sheet no longer shows them as if they were
  bought purchases.

- **2026-06-29 · fix — make CharGen→Live Sheet export create a file again** (`DATA.version`
  stayed **v0.322**; exporter-only fix). The Live Sheet export button now completes its save/download
  path successfully by avoiding a broken mutator reference during event-log generation, so CharGen can
  produce a downloadable Live-Sheet JSON file again.

- **2026-06-29 · fix — make CharGen→Live Sheet export emit native per-item events** (`DATA.version`
  stayed **v0.322**; `compute()` unchanged; exporter-only change). CharGen export now emits discrete
  native buy events for boons, drawbacks, skills, saves, expertise, tools, masteries, racial traits,
  arts, features, subclasses, and other itemized purchases so imported characters behave like native
  Live-Sheet buys, including drawback buy-off and per-line ledger entries.

- **2026-06-28 · data — apply PHB page numbers and drawback text updates to `js/engine.js`** (`DATA.version`
  stayed **v0.322**; `compute()` unchanged; display-only data only). Added `page: 214` to the 8 weapon
  masteries, added PHB `page` values to the 41 listed arts/techniques, and replaced the 10 listed
  `drawbackFx` strings with the fuller Players Guide wording. Verified `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`
  reports **5 passed / 0 failed**.

- **2026-06-28 · data — fill PHB page numbers + sync drawback text into `js/engine.js`** (`DATA.version`
  stays **v0.322** — display data only, `compute()` unchanged; engine-parity unaffected). Weapon-mastery
  PHB pages → `DATA.masteryFx[*].page` = **214** (all 8). Arts & Techniques pages → `page` added to **41 of
  43** `DATA.arts[*]` (matched to the PHB feat list; *Blessed Warrior* + *Druidic Warrior* have no PHB feat
  entry, left page-less). Drawback descriptions reconciled against the **Players Guide v0.324**: 53 already
  identical, **10 synced** to the guide's fuller wording (added DEX/WIS "cap" clauses — already enforced by
  `DATA.drawbackMaxStats`, so display-only). Land it via `docs/ENGINE-DATA-UPDATE.md`. See `DECISIONS.md` D-014.
