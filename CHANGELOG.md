# PACT — Changelog

> One line per change, **newest first**. `DATA.version` is noted only when it changed.
> This is the scannable, going-forward log; the full pre-GitHub history is in
> `docs/history/CHANGELOG-full.md`. *Why* lives in `DECISIONS.md`; the messy middle in `docs/sessions/`.

## How to add an entry
Add at the TOP. Format:
`- **<date> · <type> — <headline>** (<proof: tests pass, files touched>). <what changed, condensed>.`
`<type>` ∈ `feature · rule · fix · data · UI · tooling · docs`. Note `DATA.version` only if it changed.

- **2026-06-28 · data — fill PHB page numbers + sync drawback text into `js/engine.js`** (`DATA.version`
  stays **v0.322** — display data only, `compute()` unchanged; engine-parity unaffected). Weapon-mastery
  PHB pages → `DATA.masteryFx[*].page` = **214** (all 8). Arts & Techniques pages → `page` added to **41 of
  43** `DATA.arts[*]` (matched to the PHB feat list; *Blessed Warrior* + *Druidic Warrior* have no PHB feat
  entry, left page-less). Drawback descriptions reconciled against the **Players Guide v0.324**: 53 already
  identical, **10 synced** to the guide's fuller wording (added DEX/WIS "cap" clauses — already enforced by
  `DATA.drawbackMaxStats`, so display-only). Land it via `docs/ENGINE-DATA-UPDATE.md`. See `DECISIONS.md` D-014.
