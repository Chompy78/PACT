# PACT — Roadmap

> Written for agentic assistants (VS Code Copilot & Claude Code). With `AGENTS.md` committed, you don't
> repeat project context — **paste one task at a time**, review the diff, accept. Each task ends with a
> **Done when** check.
>
> **Rules for this file** (see `AGENTS.md`):
> 1. Holds only **open / planned** work. When a task is DONE, **move it into `CHANGELOG.md`** in the same change.
> 2. **Single writer.** Agents: *output* new items in this format for the human to fold in — don't append directly.
> 3. One task per branch. The open git branch is the "in flight" signal.
>
> **`REV-NN` items** come from the 2026-06-29 code review. Full evidence, code, and acceptance criteria
> live in **`docs/PACT-Code-Review-2026-06-29.md`** — commit that file alongside this roadmap so the
> pointers resolve. Findings are filed by severity: HIGH → Now, MEDIUM → Next, LOW → Later.

Completed work (PWA shell, auth, cloud sync, campaigns, hardening, landing-page redesign, PHB data,
**REV-01** regression gate, **REV-02** SW same-origin cache fix, **REV-03** SW network-first,
**CU-1** agent docs, **CU-2** version sync, **CU-3** repo tidy, **CU-6** DM Console rename, **CU-4** branch
prune, PWA stale-version reload-prompt fix, Live Sheet mobile density/collapse) has landed and graduated
to `CHANGELOG.md`.

# 🔴 NOW — high-severity fixes + cleanup

_(none currently — the last NOW item, the full engine module-bridge migration, graduated to
`CHANGELOG.md` on 2026-07-10.)_

# 🟡 NEXT — medium-severity fixes + remaining build work

## Feature: Advancement tracks + D&D 2024 level equivalency — TODO
Branch feat/advancement-tracks. Store AP-per-level advancement tracks (slow/average/fast + custom) and a D&D 2024 equivalent level reference table; let DMs select or customise a track per campaign.

```text
Add advancement track data to js/engine.js DATA (or a separate js/advancement.js imported by the engine) as a display-only reference — never read by compute(). Each track (slow/average/fast) defines cumulative AP thresholds per level. Also add a D&D 2024 equivalent level mapping (PACT AP total → approximate D&D 2024 level) as a display reference only.

In DM Console, add a campaign setting for advancement track: the DM can pick slow/average/fast or define a custom track (AP values per level). Store the selection in the campaign record in Supabase (DM-authoritative, RLS-protected).

In Live Sheet (and optionally DM Console), display the character's current D&D 2024 equivalent level as a read-only label derived from total AP spent + the D&D equivalency table.

Display-only — do NOT bump DATA.version; just log in CHANGELOG.

Note: the AP-by-level table is now externalized in `js/ap-by-level.js` (D-GH49, exposed as `DATA.apByLevel`). Build advancement tracks on top of that single source — reuse `AP_BY_LEVEL` as the "average" baseline rather than duplicating the AP ladder here.
```

**Done when:** advancement tracks are stored in engine data; a DM can select or customise a track per campaign; the Live Sheet shows the D&D 2024 equivalent level label; parity still 20/0.

# ⚪ LATER — low-severity fixes + ideas (not scheduled)

**Low-severity review findings:**
- **REV-14** — (optional, engine-targeted) Extract `DATA` into `engine-data.json`; split `compute()` into
  named sub-pricers. Only safe once REV-01 gives real assertions; dedicated PR, byte-identical output.

**Polish & hardening** (from the Task 5 audit session):
- **Real icons** — replace the placeholder 192/512/180 PNGs with real artwork (needs your art).

**Landing-page follow-ups** (deferred from the redesign):
- Extend theming to the guide and tools (index-only today).
- "Continue / recent characters" on the landing page (needs the tools' save format).
- iOS "Add to Home Screen" hint (no `beforeinstallprompt` on iOS Safari).

**Supporting reference tasks** (run when needed):
- Supabase project setup · Icon & asset list (192/512/180) · Offline UX spec · Future-features roadmap.

**Improvements** (recommended action first; the *then* line is a lower-priority upgrade with its caveat):
- **A1 — Engine API contract.** *(base shipped 2026-07-13)* Full JSDoc contract now sits atop `js/engine.js`.
  *Remaining (optional):* a dev-only `engine.d.ts` for IDE autocomplete — *caveat:* a new format to maintain;
  can read as "TypeScript creeping in."
- **A3 — Client error visibility.** *(base shipped 2026-07-13)* Global `error`/`unhandledrejection` surface +
  Report-issue link now on all pages. *Remaining (lower priority):* log errors to a Supabase table once
  sign-in is the default — *caveats:* extra write traffic + a privacy note to document.
- **A6 — Tag releases to the build version.** `git tag v0.x` (matching `BUILD`) + a GitHub Release per
  ship, for a labelled rollback point. *Then (lighter alternative):* tags only, no notes — *caveat:* less
  context on what each release shipped.
- **A7 — Lighthouse 85 → 90.** Add a Lighthouse CI GitHub Action to auto-catch perf regressions. *Then
  (lower priority, higher risk):* split/lazy-load the engine (= REV-14) for the real score gain —
  *caveats:* a big engine change; do it only after REV-01 makes the gate real.
- **Harden `search_path` on SECURITY DEFINER functions against temp-table shadowing.** Every SECURITY
  DEFINER function in `sql/schema.sql`/`sql/rls-policies.sql` (11+ instances, pre-existing) sets
  `search_path = public` without also listing `pg_temp`, which doesn't fully close the classic
  session-local-temp-table-shadowing pitfall. Low real-world exploitability today (Supabase/PostgREST
  clients have no raw-SQL/DDL path), but worth closing repo-wide rather than piecemeal — a partial fix
  across only some functions would be worse than no fix. Change every `set search_path = public` to
  `set search_path = public, pg_temp` consistently; new dated migration; re-run
  `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` (20/0) and the Supabase advisor. Found during `/code-review` on
  PR #203. Branch `fix/harden-search-path-pg-temp`.
**Code-review follow-ups (from `feat/campaign-ap-model`)** — low-severity cleanup flagged by
`/code-review`, not fixed in that PR (low risk / negligible impact either way):

# Conventions
- One task per branch/commit; re-open `engine-parity.html` after each.
- Keep `js/engine.js` off-limits unless a task targets it.
- When a task here is done, move it to `CHANGELOG.md` — don't leave DONE items here.
