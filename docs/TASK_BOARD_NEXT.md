# PACT — Task Board

> Written for agentic assistants (VS Code Copilot & Claude Code). With `AGENTS.md` committed, you don't
> repeat project context — **paste one task at a time**, review the diff, accept. Each task ends with a
> **Done when** check.
>
> **Rules for this file** (see `AGENTS.md`):
> 1. Holds only **open / planned** work. When a task is DONE, **move it into `CHANGELOG.md`** in the same change.
> 2. **Single writer.** Agents: *output* new items in this format for the human to fold in — don't append directly.
> 3. One task per branch. The open git branch is the "in flight" signal.
>
> **`REV-NN` items** come from the 2026-06-29 code review. Full evidence, code, and acceptance criteria
> live in **`docs/PACT-Code-Review-2026-06-29.md`** — commit that file alongside this task board so the

# 🟡 NEXT — medium-severity fixes + remaining build work


## Port the AGENTS.md/skills scaffold to another repo — TODO
Branch docs/port-agents-scaffold-skill. Generalize this session's manual copy-and-adapt work (porting
AGENTS.md + .claude/commands/ + hooks to chompy78/petdetective and chompy78/homelife — see
docs/sessions/2026-07-17-port-agents-scaffold-to-petdetective-homelife.md) into a repeatable PACT skill,
so a future "bring this workflow to repo X" request doesn't redo the analysis from scratch.
**Effort:** high · **Risk:** high — ambiguity is high (how prescriptive vs. flexible the skill should be —
auto-detect target conventions vs. always ask, how much to generalize vs. leave as human judgment — is a
genuine design call with no single obviously-right answer, the same way this session had to improvise two
different adaptations for two differently-shaped repos); damage scale is low (only touches
.claude/commands/ in whichever repo it's run against, and per this session's established practice should
always draft-then-show-for-approval before writing to a foreign repo, so a bad output is caught before
landing); damage likelihood is medium (nothing automated gates a skill's own prompt content — a flawed
skill design only surfaces the next time someone actually runs it against a real target repo) — worst-of
lands at high on ambiguity alone, so never eligible for /sweep-code-tasks; recommend `/make-code-cold-plan-review` before
implementation given the design-call nature.

```text
1. Read this session's session note (docs/sessions/2026-07-17-port-agents-scaffold-to-petdetective-homelife.md)
   and the two target repos' actual results (chompy78/petdetective's docs/agent-scaffold branch/PR #4,
   chompy78/homelife's commit ede0496) as the worked examples to generalize from.

2. Design a new skill, e.g. `.claude/commands/port-agents-scaffold.md`, that:
   - Takes a target repo as its argument.
   - Reads the target's actual current state first — does it already have AGENTS.md/CHANGELOG.md/
     DECISIONS.md/a task board? Does it have a test suite/CI? What's its branch model (single branch vs.
     branch-per-task, main vs. some other default)?
   - Branches its own behavior on what it finds: a blank-slate target gets the full scaffold built fresh
     (per the petdetective pattern); a target with existing mature governance docs gets only the missing
     pieces added, with small additive notes in the existing docs rather than any rewrite (per the
     homelife pattern).
   - **Explicitly handles the main-only case:** if the target's own stated or observed convention is
     commit-and-push-straight-to-main (no feature-branch workflow), the ported pick-code-task/run-code-task/
     sweep-code-tasks/cleanup-code-branches skills must drop all worktree/branch/PR machinery and work directly
     against that branch instead — never introduce branches/PRs into a repo whose established convention
     is branch-less, even for consistency with PACT's own model.
   - Always drafts the adapted files and shows them (or a summary) for approval before writing/committing/
     pushing anything to the target repo — same draft-before-write discipline `/add-code-task`,
     `/log-code-lesson`, and `/make-code-cold-plan-review` already use.
   - Pauses before pushing to the target repo if that repo has no PR gate (a direct push to its main
     branch may trigger an immediate live deploy, as it did for homelife) — flag this explicitly rather
     than pushing straight through.

3. Update `docs/SKILLS.md` to document the new skill alongside the existing eight.
```

**Done when:** the new skill exists, is documented in `docs/SKILLS.md`, and has been dry-run (or actually
run) against at least one real target repo of each shape (a blank-slate repo and a repo with existing,
possibly-conflicting governance docs) with correct behavior in both cases.

## REV-14b — split js/engine.js's compute() into named sub-pricers — TODO
Branch refactor/rev-14b-compute-subpricers. Second half of REV-14 (REV-14a — the DATA extraction — shipped
in PR #251); decompose compute()'s single ~370-line body (~lines 76–446) into named `_price*` helpers. Full
plan already drafted at docs/plans/2026-07-17-engine-breakup-rev14.md.
**Effort:** high · **Risk:** high — ambiguity is high (decomposing a stateful pricing algorithm while
guaranteeing byte-identical output is a genuine architectural call); damage scale is high (edits compute()
directly — the engine's single source of truth); damage likelihood is medium (the parity gate catches
numeric/ledger drift, but REV-01's known warning-text fixture-coverage gap means some W.push branches are
unverified) — worst-of lands at high, never eligible for /sweep-code-tasks.

```text
1. Pre-flight (no code change): produce a data-flow map of which compute() locals each commented section
   reads vs writes (total, L, W, mod, effScore, the add() closure, any first-occurrence/suppression state),
   and confirm the exact line span of the _raceTraitLocked creation-lock logic so extraction-by-comment-
   boundary can't split it.
2. Extract each commented section into a named _price* helper taking ONE SHARED MUTABLE CONTEXT
   ({total, L, W, mod, effScore, add, …}) and mutating it exactly as the inline code did — NOT return-and-
   merge (which forces hidden inter-section dependencies to be made explicit and is where silent drift
   creeps in). Preserve L (ledger) and W (warnings) push order exactly.
3. Extract one section per commit; run engine-parity after each so any regression is bisectable. compute()
   ends as setup + a fixed ordered sequence of _price* calls + return assembly, same signature/return shape.
4. Verify byte-identical output: hash the full compute() return (totals + ledger L + warnings W) for every
   fixture before vs after; list any W.push branch no fixture reaches. This is a BEHAVIOUR-PRESERVING engine
   change — do NOT bump DATA.version (output must be identical); just log in CHANGELOG.
```

**Done when:** compute() is a dispatcher over named `_price*` helpers (shared-context design), unchanged
signature/return shape; full-payload output identical across all fixtures; engine-parity still 20/0.

## Prevent Supabase free-tier auto-pause (keep-alive or paid upgrade) — TODO
Branch chore/supabase-keep-alive. The PACT Supabase project auto-paused from inactivity today (2026-07-25),
which silently broke login/register app-wide with "Failed to fetch" until manually restored via
`mcp__Supabase__restore_project` — evaluate and implement a fix so this doesn't recur, especially before
PACT has real users relying on cloud sync/DM campaigns.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity is medium (scheduled keep-alive ping vs. paid-tier
upgrade is a real but low-stakes call, not architectural); damage scale is low (a new CI workflow file
only, easily reverted, no engine/app code touched, uses only the already-committed anon key); damage
likelihood is low (worst case on failure is a return to today's status quo, not a new/worse failure
mode) — eligible for `/sweep-code-tasks`.

```text
1. Evaluate two options and pick one (or recommend the paid-tier one to the user as a billing decision
   they must approve, since it's a recurring cost):
   a. A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (e.g. .github/workflows/supabase-keepalive.yml) that pings the
      Supabase project on a cron cadence tighter than the free-tier auto-pause window (~7 days of
      inactivity) — e.g. every 3 days, a lightweight authenticated request using only the already-committed
      publishable/anon key (js/supabase-client.js's SUPABASE_URL/SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY). This is CI/ops
      tooling, not app backend code, so it doesn't conflict with the "GitHub Pages only, no custom backend"
      rule (same class as the existing Lighthouse CI workflow).
   b. Upgrade the Supabase project to a paid tier, which removes auto-pause entirely — flag this to the
      user explicitly rather than deciding unilaterally, since it's a recurring cost only they can approve.
2. Default to (a) unless the user explicitly opts into (b). If implementing (a), verify the workflow
   actually prevents pausing (check project status stays ACTIVE_HEALTHY across a full off-cadence window)
   before considering this done.
3. Log the decision (workflow vs. paid-tier, and why) as D-GH-<date>-supabase-keep-alive in DECISIONS.md.
```

**Done when:** a scheduled keep-alive workflow is running and has been confirmed to keep the Supabase
project's status `ACTIVE_HEALTHY` across at least one full auto-pause window (or, if the user chose the
paid-tier path instead, the project has been upgraded and auto-pause confirmed disabled), and the decision
is logged in DECISIONS.md.

## Support banning a class as a 2nd origin only (mirror the species asymmetric-ban pattern) — TODO
Branch feat/banned-2nd-origin-class. Investigated while adding boon/drawback tooltips (2026-07-25):
`js/engine.js`'s `validate()` already bans an origin class in **both** `originClass`/`originClass2` slots
via one `bannedOriginClasses` list — there's no equivalent to species' `bannedOriginSpecies` (an
asymmetric list banning a species *only* as a bonus 2nd origin, while still allowing it as a primary
species). This is a genuine engine gap, not a UI oversight: add a mirrored `bannedOriginClasses2`-style
rule so a DM can allow a class as a primary origin but ban it as a stacked 2nd origin, same as species
already supports.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity is medium (an exact precedent exists to mirror —
`bannedOriginSpecies`'s schema field, `validate()` branch at `js/engine.js` ~lines 689-691, and DM
Console's "Banned as 2nd origin species" rule grid — but naming the new field and confirming CharGen's
embedded engine copy needs the same update are real, if low-stakes, calls); damage scale is medium
(touches `js/engine.js`'s `validate()`, not `compute()`/`_replay()`/`DATA.version` directly, so per
`AGENTS.md`'s rubric this doesn't hit the High tier, but it's still the rules engine); damage likelihood
is medium (no fixture currently exercises `bannedOriginClasses`-style violations, so nothing automated
would catch a wrong implementation) — eligible for `/sweep-code-tasks`, but touches `js/engine.js` so
treat with the file's usual care.

```text
1. Mirror the exact species pattern:
   - `js/engine.js`: add a new rule-schema field (e.g. `bannedOriginClasses2`) alongside
     `bannedOriginSpecies` in `RULE_BAN_FIELDS` (~line 733-745).
   - `validate()`: add a branch checking `b.originClass2` against the new list, mirroring the
     `bannedOriginSpecies` check at ~lines 689-691 (banned only in the 2nd-origin slot, not slot 1).
2. `tools/DM-Console.html`: add a "Banned as 2nd origin classes" rule grid (mirroring
   `ruleBannedOriginSpecies`) to `RULE_GRIDS` and the Campaign Rules panel markup, options from
   `DATA.classes` (same source `ruleBannedOriginClasses` already uses).
3. Best done after Task 6, or update CharGen's embedded engine copy in the same PR — check whether
   CharGen's local copy also needs the new field/validate() branch (per AGENTS.md's Task 6 note).
4. Check whether this changes any existing REV-01 fixture's output (it shouldn't — the new list only
   fires when a DM explicitly sets it, which no existing fixture does). If genuinely output-neutral for
   all current fixtures, do NOT bump DATA.version — log in CHANGELOG. If any fixture's violations output
   changes, bump DATA.version and update testing/expected/ in the same PR.
```

**Done when:** a DM can ban a class as a 2nd-origin-only pick (allowed as primary, banned as bonus 2nd)
via a new DM Console rule grid, `validate()` enforces it, `testing/tests/engine-parity.html` is still 20/0.

## DM manually adds/imports a character to a campaign, then hands off ownership via a claim link — TODO
Branch feat/character-ownership-claim-link. Today a DM can only get a NEW character into their campaign
by generating a player-invite link that creates a **blank** character owned by whoever redeems it
(`createPlayerInvite`/`redeemPlayerInvite`), or a player can bind an **already-owned** character to a
campaign via a reusable code (`bindCharacterToCampaign`). Neither covers: a DM building or importing a
fully-formed character themselves (e.g. an NPC promoted to PC, or a file a player emailed them) and then
handing *ownership* of that specific character to a player. Confirmed via `grep -n "owner_id"
sql/rls-policies.sql`: no ownership-transfer path exists anywhere today — `characters_update`'s RLS
policy requires `owner_id = auth.uid()` in **both** its `using` and `with check` clauses, so even a raw
table update can never reassign `owner_id`; the only insert grant (`grant insert (id, owner_id, name,
kind, stats)`) sets it once at creation. This is a brand-new SECURITY DEFINER RPC + invite-token flow,
not a wiring-up-an-existing-function task like `createCampaign`/`joinAsDm` were.
**Effort:** high · **Risk:** high — ambiguity is high (real open design questions below, no single
obviously-right answer); damage scale is high (a new ownership-transfer RPC is a genuine security/
trust-boundary change touching live character data — same class of decision `DECISIONS.md` already
treats carefully, e.g. the feedback-widget anon-write table call); damage likelihood is medium-to-high
(nothing automated would catch an authorization bug in a brand-new RPC until it's actually misused) —
worst-of high, never eligible for `/sweep-code-tasks`; recommend `/make-code-cold-plan-review` before
implementation given the trust-boundary + design-call nature.

```text
Open design questions to resolve BEFORE implementing (don't guess — surface for a human/cold-review):
1. How does the DM get the character into the campaign in the first place, while keeping DM Console's
   own stated "read-only, never edits a character" design principle intact? Options: (a) DM builds/
   imports it in CharGen under their own account, bound to the campaign, then generates the claim link
   from CharGen or DM Console; (b) DM Console gains a new, explicit non-read-only capability for this
   one flow, breaking its current invariant; (c) something else.
2. Claim-link semantics: single-use (like campaign_invites/redeem_player_invite) vs. a reusable code?
   Expiry? Can the DM revoke/regenerate it before redemption?
3. What happens to `ap` (DM-awarded, server-authoritative) across the transfer — it should carry over
   untouched per "store raw, derive the rest," but does `ap_awards.dm_id` still make sense pointing at
   the original DM after ownership moves?
4. Authorization for the new RPC: must verify the redeemer isn't already the owner, the character is
   actually unclaimed/transferable, and the caller is a genuine distinct user — mirroring
   redeem_player_invite's idempotency guard (a repeat call by the same user returns the same result
   instead of erroring).
5. Does the player need to consent/confirm before ownership silently changes hands to them, or is
   redeeming the link itself the confirmation?

Steps (once the above are resolved, not before):
1. Design the schema: likely a new invite-token table/column (or extend campaign_invites with a
   character_id + a kind discriminator) for "claim an existing character" tokens, distinct from today's
   "create a new character" tokens.
2. New SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (e.g. create_character_claim(character_id) / redeem_character_claim(token)),
   owner-of-the-character-gated on creation, single-use on redemption, updating characters.owner_id —
   the only path that may ever do so.
3. UI: wherever the DM actually gets the character into the campaign (per design question 1), add a
   "Generate claim link" action; the redemption side likely reuses the existing invite-redemption
   page pattern.
4. Log the ownership-transfer design decision in DECISIONS.md — exactly the kind of security-model
   choice AGENTS.md asks to be recorded.
```

**Done when:** a DM can get a specific, already-built character into their campaign under their own
account, generate a link, and have a named player redeem it to become that character's owner — with the
RPC-level authorization verified (only the current owner can create a claim link; only a genuine distinct
redemption can consume it) and the design questions above resolved and recorded in DECISIONS.md before
merging.

## Purge the "pace curve" mislabel from the historical records — TODO
Branch docs/pace-curve-terminology. `D-GH-2026-08-03-ap-budget-curve-standard` established that PACT has
no AP-earned-per-level curve at all — the `{1:50 … 20:491}` ladder was the Players Guide appendix's
twenty pregenerated Emberwatch sample characters, and the rules define only a *budget* curve (Standard
L1 79/+24, Generous 83/+28, prelude L0 55) and an *award pace* (AP per session, ~7). Live code was
corrected in that change; several archival records still assert the wrong framing as settled fact.
**Effort:** low · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity is low (the correct wording is already settled by
`D-GH-2026-08-03-ap-budget-curve-standard`, one obviously-right annotation per site) and damage scale is
low (docs only, fully `git revert`-able, no code, data or security surface); damage likelihood is medium
— nothing automated gates doc prose, and the real hazard is an agent "tidying" a historical record and
silently dropping reasoning, which AGENTS.md's edit-don't-regenerate rule exists to prevent.

```text
Annotate — do NOT rewrite. These are historical records of what was believed at the time; the repo's
convention is a dated correction note or addendum, the same shape as the existing "Addendum (2026-08-03)"
in D-GH-2026-08-02-creation-lock-switch.md. Preserve the original wording and reasoning verbatim; add a
short note beside it pointing at D-GH-2026-08-03-ap-budget-curve-standard. Never regenerate a whole file.

Sites (verified by grep on 2026-08-03 — re-grep before editing, they may have moved):
1. DECISIONS.md:448 — "left js/ap-by-level.js untouched (pace curve != budget curve)". The parenthetical
   is the mislabel; the decision it describes was still correct at the time.
2. decisions/2026/D-GH49.md:8 — cites DATA.levelAP as {1:50…20:491} / DATA.level1AP 50. Numbers are now
   79-based; note the supersession rather than editing the figures in place.
3. decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-07-14-advancement-tracks.md:9 — "(AP earned by level: 1->50…20->491, which is
   exactly what js/ap-by-level.js's AP_BY_LEVEL already is)". This record ALSO contains the follow-up
   note that predicted a DATA.version bump would be needed; that prediction came true, so cross-link it.
4. decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-02-creation-lock-switch.md:78/86/88 — the 2026-08-03 addendum's whole
   two-curve framing. Its mechanism (threshold reads the campaign budget curve) is unaffected and must
   stay; only the "pace curve" naming and the L1=50 figure are wrong.
5. docs/sessions/2026-07-14-advancement-tracks-review-saga.md:22 — session note. Lowest priority; a
   single dated footnote at the top is enough for a session log.

Also re-grep for "1st-level recruit", "491" and "+21/level" outside docs/PACT-Players-Guide.html,
docs/history/ and CHANGELOG-archive-*.md, in case a site was missed.

Docs-only: do NOT bump DATA.version; log the sweep in CHANGELOG.md as one line. No new DECISIONS.md
entry is needed — D-GH-2026-08-03-ap-budget-curve-standard already carries the "why", and this task is
listed there under "Caveats and follow-ups".
```

**Done when:** `grep -rn "pace curve\|PACE curve" --include=*.md --include=*.js --include=*.html .`
returns no hit that presents the term as current fact outside `docs/history/` and the changelog archive
(hits inside an explicit correction note are fine and expected), every edited record still contains its
original wording, and parity still reports 0 failed.

## Signed-out invite banner still can't distinguish a dead link from a live one — TODO
Branch `feat/invite-peek-signed-out-banner`. Remainder of the 2026-08-04 finding after
`feat/invite-peek-campaign-name` shipped (2026-08-10): `peek_player_invite(token)` now lets CharGen name
the campaign in its accept `confirm()` and catch a dead token before ever showing that prompt — but only
once the player is signed in. Signed OUT, a revoked/expired invite link still looks identical to a live
one, because `peek_player_invite` was deliberately scoped `authenticated`-only
(`D-GH-2026-08-10-invite-peek-auth-scope`) rather than anon-callable, to avoid an unrate-limited token-probe
surface. **Blocked on `feat/invite-rate-limiting`** landing first — that is what would make an
anon-callable lookup a deliberate, safe decision rather than reopening the exact hole this one avoided.
**Effort:** small (once unblocked) · **Risk:** medium — the auth-scope call was already made deliberately
in D-GH-2026-08-10-invite-peek-auth-scope; this task is "make it anon-callable now that rate limiting
exists," not a fresh design question. Not sweep-eligible — sequenced behind another task.

```text
1. Confirm feat/invite-rate-limiting has actually landed and covers RPC-level probing, not just invite
   generation/redemption, before starting.
2. Widen peek_player_invite's grant to anon (or add a second, anon-scoped variant if the rate-limit
   mechanism needs a distinct code path) — record the change as an amendment to
   D-GH-2026-08-10-invite-peek-auth-scope, not a fresh decision.
3. Make the signed-out banner in tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html's tryRedeem() call it and distinguish a
   dead invite from a live one, mirroring the signed-in copy already shipped.
4. Add cloud-e2e coverage for a revoked token and a valid one, both signed out.
```

**Done when:** the signed-out banner distinguishes a dead invite from a live one, the widened auth scope
is recorded as an amendment to D-GH-2026-08-10-invite-peek-auth-scope, and `cloud-e2e` covers both token
states signed out.

## DM sets how many characters one player may have in a campaign — TODO
Branch `feat/campaign-character-limit`. Today the limit is hard-wired to exactly **one** character per
player per campaign, and it is not a soft app rule: it is the unique index
`idx_characters_owner_campaign_unique` on `characters(owner_id, campaign_id) where campaign_id is not
null` (`sql/schema.sql`, added by `sql/migrations/2026-07-13-campaign-bind-character.sql`). Requested by
the owner, who wanted two copies of a character in one campaign for a diagnosis and found the limit
was a database invariant rather than a setting.

**The trap that makes this bigger than "drop the index":** that index is not merely a limit, it is the
**TOCTOU race guard** for `bind_character_to_campaign` — the RPC's `EXISTS`-then-write check cannot
close the window on its own, which is exactly why the index exists (see its comment in `sql/schema.sql`
and in `sql/migrations/2026-07-13-campaign-join-race-friendly-error.sql`, which added the friendly error
for the duplicate-key it raises). Dropping it to allow N-per-player would silently reopen that race.
A partial or expression index cannot express "at most N rows per (owner, campaign)" either, so the
guard has to move — most likely into the RPC itself under a `select … for update` on the campaign row,
or a count check inside a serializable transaction. **Get this design reviewed before implementing**
(`/make-code-cold-plan-review`): it is a concurrency change to production data, and a wrong answer here
is a duplicate-join bug that only shows up under real simultaneous joins.

**Effort:** large · **Risk:** high — schema + RPC + RLS + UI; the failure mode is silent (a race that
only bites under concurrency), and it touches the one invariant that currently makes double-joins
impossible. **Not** sweep-eligible.

```text
1. Decide where the limit lives: `campaigns.rules.maxCharactersPerPlayer` (integer, default 1) is the
   natural home — it rides the existing rules JSON, so no new column and DM Console already has a rules
   panel and a save path.
2. Replace the unique index with a guard that still closes the race at N. Do NOT simply drop it. The
   count check has to be race-safe against two simultaneous redemptions of the same invite.
3. Teach bind_character_to_campaign and redeem_player_invite the limit: the current one-per-campaign
   EXISTS check becomes a count-against-limit check, and the friendly error message needs to state the
   actual limit ("Amble allows 2 characters per player") rather than today's fixed wording.
4. DM Console: a number input in the campaign rules panel, next to the starting tier. Default 1.
   Lowering it below what players already hold must NOT delete or unbind anything — existing rosters
   are grandfathered; the limit only gates new joins. Say so in the field's ⓘ.
5. CharGen's join path shows the campaign's limit when a join is refused for hitting it.
6. Migration under sql/migrations/, then run the Supabase advisor and skim get_logs (per-change
   checklist step 4). Rules-only change to the DB — no DATA.version bump.
7. cloud-e2e: cover limit=1 (today's behaviour, must not regress), limit=2 (second join succeeds), and
   the refusal at the limit. A concurrency check for the race guard if one can be written cheaply.
```

**Done when:** a DM can set the per-player character limit on a campaign, the default of 1 reproduces
today's behaviour exactly, joining past the limit fails with a message naming the limit, lowering the
limit never removes an existing character, the race guard is demonstrably still closed at the new N,
the advisor reports no new findings, and `cloud-e2e` covers limit=1, limit=2 and the refusal.

## Password reset is broken end-to-end — the email link lands on the homepage — TODO
Branch `fix/password-reset-flow`. Reported by the owner: clicking the reset link in the recovery email
takes you to the main PACT homepage, not to anywhere you can set a new password. Confirmed in the code,
and it is **two** defects, not one — fixing only the link would still leave the flow dead:

1. **Wrong destination.** `js/auth.js:41-43` calls `resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo:
   REDIRECT_BASE })`, and `REDIRECT_BASE` (`js/auth.js:12`) is `https://chompy78.github.io/PACT/` — the
   app menu. `index.html` has no recovery handling, so the recovery session is established and then
   silently discarded.
2. **There is no reset page at all.** `setNewPassword()` exists (`js/auth.js:52`, calling
   `supabase.auth.updateUser({password})`, with a comment noting Supabase has put the user in a
   temporary recovery session by then) but **nothing anywhere calls it** — verified by grep across all
   `.html`/`.js` outside `js/vendor/`. `login.html` has no recovery branch and no new-password form.
   So even pointed at `login.html`, the link would land on a sign-in form the user can't use.

**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — auth flow on production, and the failure mode is a locked-out
user rather than a visible error. Needs a real end-to-end test with a live recovery email; the happy
path cannot be verified by unit-level checks alone. Not sweep-eligible.

```text
1. Add a recovery branch (a `?type=recovery` route on login.html, or a small reset.html) that listens
   for Supabase's PASSWORD_RECOVERY auth event and shows a new-password form, then calls the existing
   setNewPassword(). Prefer login.html — one auth page, one place service-worker caching has to be
   right — unless the fragment handling makes a dedicated page materially simpler.
2. Point resetPasswordForEmail's redirectTo at that page. Note REDIRECT_BASE is ALSO used by signUp's
   emailRedirectTo (js/auth.js:25), where the homepage IS correct — so introduce a separate constant
   rather than repointing the shared one.
3. Add the new URL to the Supabase project's Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs allow-list.
   A redirect not on that list is silently rewritten to the Site URL — which is very likely the real
   reason this lands on the homepage, so CHECK THIS FIRST: the allow-list may make step 2 a no-op
   until it is fixed, and it is a dashboard setting, not a repo change.
4. The recovery token arrives in the URL fragment/query and is consumed on load — make sure the page
   reads it before anything (service worker, a redirect, a router) can drop it, and that the service
   worker does not serve a cached copy of the page that misses the fragment handler.
5. Handle the expired/already-used token case with a real message and a way to request a new email,
   not a blank form.
6. Confirm sign-UP confirmation emails still land on the homepage correctly after the constant split.
```

**Done when:** a real recovery email's link opens a page that accepts a new password, the new password
works for sign-in, an expired link says so and offers a resend, the signup confirmation email is
unaffected, and the redirect URL is on the Supabase allow-list.

## Live Sheet: should a PRE-LOCK character reconcile to compute()? — TODO
Branch `fix/livesheet-draft-reconcile`. Surfaced by `fix/species-pack-not-charged` (2026-08-05) while
verifying that CharGen's draft reconciliation had not left the same hole in the other tool. It had not —
this is a different question, and it needs a **rules answer before any code**.

`decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-05-pricing-model.md` D1 and D2 conflict for one case neither anticipated.
Measured in a real browser on a fresh Live Sheet character, well under the 79 AP threshold and so a draft
by D2's definition:

| step | ledger | `compute()` |
|---|---|---|
| CON 16, Vigor 2, Grit 3 | 32 | 32 |
| level 1→2 | 34 | 46 |
| level 2→5 | **44** | **83** |

Ordinary purchases reconcile exactly; only the level-ups diverge. Neither rule is being broken, which is
the problem: **D2** says a draft reconciles (so the Live Sheet would need `repriceDraft` too), while **D1**
says a context change takes its listed price and levelling is a real context change even during creation
(so the divergence is correct and D2's wording needs narrowing to *"while no context change has occurred"*).

CharGen is unaffected either way — it builds at one level, and its edits are revisions of a single draft
rather than progression. This bites only where a pre-lock character levels up.

**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** high — it decides what a pre-lock ledger means, and the wrong answer here
would be re-litigated by `fix/ledger-reconciliation-pass`. Not sweep-eligible; needs an owner decision.

```text
1. OWNER DECISION FIRST, no code until it is recorded: does a pre-lock character who levels up keep
   listed prices (divergence correct), or re-price to one context (ledger reconciles)?
2. Record it as an amendment to D-GH-2026-08-05-pricing-model — it narrows either D1 or D2, so the
   record must say which, or the next agent will read the two rules as still conflicting.
3. If "reconcile": call the engine's repriceDraft() from the Live Sheet's emit path, exactly as CharGen
   does. The export already exists and is fuzz-covered; this is wiring, not new logic.
4. If "listed prices are correct": narrow D2's wording, and add the measured table above to the record
   as the worked example — an undocumented 44-vs-83 will be re-reported as a bug otherwise.
5. Either way add the case to testing/scripts/tool-pricing-ci.mjs so the chosen answer is asserted
   rather than remembered.
```

**Done when:** the owner's answer is recorded in the decision record as an explicit narrowing of D1 or D2,
the Live Sheet matches it, and a gate asserts the pre-lock level-up case.

## One-off reconciliation pass for characters built before the pricing fixes — TODO
Branch `fix/ledger-reconciliation-pass`. **Sequence LAST — after all four pricing branches have landed**
(see `decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-05-pricing-model.md`, D6, where the owner decided this on 2026-08-05).
Characters built before that work carry ledgers frozen from a contaminated quoting basis: Anders is 15
against `compute()`'s 33, and every Level Up or class unlock recorded an over- or under-charge. They are
grandfathered until this runs; do not bolt a partial migration onto any individual fix.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** high — ambiguity high (what "correct" means for a character whose purchases
were made at contexts that no longer reproduce is a genuine judgement call, not a lookup); damage scale
high (rewrites frozen ledgers, the app's own record of what a player paid); damage likelihood medium (the
corpus is small and known, and the invariant is checkable afterwards) — worst-of lands at high. Not
sweep-eligible.

```text
0. SCOPE HAS SHRUNK — re-measure before planning a big inventory. Verified 2026-08-05: no tool emits
   `campaignBound` or `creationLocked` (grep across tools/ and js/ outside the engine returns nothing),
   and a character saved before feat/creation-lock-wiring carries no `creationLockConfig` either — so
   `_autoArmed` is false and `isCreationDraft()` returns TRUE for every pre-existing character. They are
   all drafts. CharGen now reprices a draft on LOAD (_cgApplyEnvelope), so every one of them self-heals
   the moment it is opened in CharGen. What is left for this pass is therefore narrower than written
   below: characters that are only ever opened in the LIVE SHEET, which does not reprice at all pending
   the rules answer in fix/livesheet-draft-reconcile. Confirm this still holds before starting.
0b. Both pricing blockers have LANDED (fix/livesheet-context-pricing and fix/species-pack-not-charged, 2026-08-05),
   but one question they raised has not been answered: fix/livesheet-draft-reconcile above decides whether
   a pre-lock Live Sheet character reconciles at all. Settle that FIRST — it changes what "correct" means
   for exactly the characters this pass rewrites. Reconciling against a moving definition is how this began.
1. Inventory first, decide second. Replay every saved character (local + cloud) and produce a table of
   frozen-sum vs compute().total, per character, with the per-event deltas that explain the gap. Do not
   write anything on this pass — the owner needs the numbers before authorising any rewrite.
2. Expect at least three distinct causes and report them separately: species packs never charged; Level
   Up over-charged by the Vigor/Grit re-price; class unlock under-charged (it could go NEGATIVE, i.e. it
   paid AP out) — so some characters are over-budget under corrected pricing and some are under.
3. Decide the shape WITH the owner: a correcting event appended per character (auditable, keeps the
   append-only property, shows in the ledger as a visible adjustment), or a rewrite of the frozen costs
   (cleaner-looking, destroys the record of what was actually paid). Default to the appended event.
4. Characters that are over-budget after correction are a product question, not an implementation one —
   ask before trimming, refunding, or granting AP to cover the difference.
5. Gate: after the pass, a corrected character's frozen sum must equal compute().total where the rules
   say it should. Add that assertion to testing/scripts/tool-pricing-ci.mjs rather than checking by hand.
6. engine-parity must stay at 0 failed and DATA.version must not move — this rewrites data, not rules.
```
**Done when:** the inventory table exists and has been reviewed by the owner, the agreed correction has
been applied to every affected saved character, over-budget outcomes have an owner decision recorded, and
a gate asserts the invariant for corrected characters.

## Tune CharGen's random character generator — TODO
Branch `feat/randomize-tuning`. `randomizeRoll()` (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html:3232`) rolls a
character but nobody has written down what a *good* roll looks like.

**⚠ Acceptance criteria are deliberately unset.** The owner asked for "tuning" without naming a
complaint, so step 1 is to capture what is actually wrong — not to guess. Do not start implementing
against invented criteria.

**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** high — ambiguity is high (what counts as a good roll is a design/taste
call only the owner can make); damage scale is low (single tool, no rules logic, `git revert` undoes it)
and damage likelihood low (`random-manual-e2e.mjs` already gates it in a real browser). Not
sweep-eligible until the owner has named concrete criteria — then re-rate.

How it works today, verified 2026-08-05 rather than assumed:
- `randomizeBuild()` confirms, then `randomizeRoll()` deep-clones `readBuild()` (= `foldBuild(LOG)`,
  cloned because the fold's nested arrays ALIAS the LOG event payloads).
- It **keeps anything already chosen** — species, class, name, budget — and fills only what is unset,
  biased toward the chosen class and species.
- The ceiling is `compute(b, _cgDmOpts()).spendable`, i.e. player AP **plus** DM-granted AP when a
  campaign is active — not the raw player budget.
- A spendable of 0 is treated as a real answer, not a missing one: it refuses with "ask your DM to
  grant some" rather than building an unaffordable ~79 AP character.

```text
1. FIRST, and before any code: get the owner to name what a bad roll looks like. Concrete examples beat
   adjectives — "rolled 3 Vigor and no skills", "spent 12 of 79 AP", "took cross-race traits it can't
   use", "every roll looks the same". Without this the task cannot be judged done.
2. Write those down IN THIS ENTRY as the acceptance criteria, then re-rate Risk (it is high only
   because they are missing) and note whether it has become sweep-eligible.
3. Only then implement. Keep the four behaviours listed above unless a criterion explicitly overrides
   one — each is a deliberate fix for a real bug, not an accident, and the spendable-of-0 refusal in
   particular has its own comment explaining what it replaced.
4. Assert the agreed criteria in `testing/scripts/random-manual-e2e.mjs`, which already drives randomize
   in a real browser against an independent oracle (D-GH-2026-07-13-random-e2e-real-oracle). Note it
   needs Playwright and so cannot run in a CLI session — if the criteria are checkable without UI
   interaction, prefer `testing/scripts/tool-pricing-ci.mjs`, which is dependency-free CDP.
5. Budget-adherence checks must read the RECONCILED ledger. `fix/species-pack-not-charged` (2026-08-05)
   changed what randomize's resulting log contains — a draft's frozen costs are now re-derived by
   `repriceDraft()` to equal `compute().total` — so asserting against the old frozen figures would be
   testing a state that no longer exists.
6. Display/UX only — randomize writes a build, it does not change rules. Do NOT bump `DATA.version`.
```

**Done when:** the owner's concrete criteria are written into this entry, the generator satisfies each
one, a test in `random-manual-e2e.mjs` (or `tool-pricing-ci.mjs`) asserts them, and engine-parity still
reports 24/0.

## CharGen quotes a locked character's context changes as a whole-build delta — TODO
Branch `fix/chargen-context-pricing`. D1 of `decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-05-pricing-model.md` — *a
purchase that changes pricing context is quoted from its own rules table, never by whole-build diff* —
was implemented for the Live Sheet's `priceOf()` only. CharGen's `replacePatchSlot()`
(`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`) still does `compute(after).total − compute(before).total`.

**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity medium (D1 already fixes the rule and the Live Sheet's
`_CTX_PRICERS` table is the pattern to copy, but CharGen prices whole patch SLOTS rather than single
categories, so the mapping is not one-to-one); damage scale medium (one tool, but it writes frozen costs
into saved logs); damage likelihood low (`tool-pricing-ci.mjs` gates it and is dependency-free).

**Re-measured 2026-08-05 (after the Grit correction and the Vigor per-rank stamp): this is now the LAST
remaining disagreement between the two tools.** Nine pricing categories were compared on identical logs;
eight agree. The survivor:

| case | Live Sheet | CharGen |
|---|---:|---:|
| unlock Wizard owning 4 Wizard features | 7 | **−6** |
| unlock Wizard owning none (control) | 7 | 7 |

CharGen *pays the player 6 AP* to unlock a class they already have features in, because the whole-build
delta sweeps in the retroactive discount those features get once the class is unlocked. The fix has the
same shape as the two that landed: stamp each feature with whether its class was unlocked when it was
bought (as `_raceTraitLocked` does for species traits and `_vigorRankTier` now does for Vigor), so an
already-owned feature keeps the cross-class price it was actually bought at.

**Why it was survivable until now, and why it no longer is.** While a character is a draft,
`repriceDraft()` overwrites whatever `replacePatchSlot()` quoted, so the bad quote never reached the
ledger. Once the lock fires, re-pricing stops by design (D7) and the quote is what gets frozen.
Reproduced 2026-08-05: a locked character with species Dwarf and four Halfling traits, switching to
Halfling, is quoted **−4** — a refund — where the listed Halfling pack price is 7. The ledger keeps it.

```text
1. Read the Live Sheet's `_CTX_PRICERS` table first; it is the same rule already solved once, and the
   two tools must not disagree about what a context change costs.
2. The mismatch to design around: `_CTX_PRICERS` is keyed by event CATEGORY (abil, hd, unlockclass…),
   but `replacePatchSlot` writes a whole SLOT (IDENTITY carries originClass, originClass2, species,
   species2, size, lineage at once). Decide whether to price a slot field-by-field against its own
   table, or to split the context-bearing fields out of the slot. Say which and why — this is the part
   worth getting reviewed.
3. Only the pricing basis changes. Do NOT reintroduce filter-and-append: replace-in-place is what keeps
   the identity line in its own position in the ledger, and it is now also what keeps a locked
   character's event indices stable.
4. The draft path must stay unchanged — `repriceDraft()` still owns pre-lock pricing, and this quote
   only ever reaches a ledger once the lock has fired. Assert both halves.
5. Gate in `testing/scripts/tool-pricing-ci.mjs` alongside the existing "re-pricing stops dead once the
   lock has fired" block, which already builds a suitable locked fixture. The assertion is that a locked
   species change is quoted at the listed pack price, independent of what traits are already owned.
6. Prices move, so if `compute()` output changes at all, bump `DATA.version` and refresh
   `testing/expected/` in the same PR. If only CharGen's recorded costs change, it does NOT move.
```

**Done when:** a locked character's species/class change is quoted at its listed price regardless of what
is already owned, CharGen and the Live Sheet agree on that price, draft re-pricing is unaffected, a gate
asserts it, and engine-parity still reports 24/0.

## A DM-applied creation lock a player cannot undo (cloud campaign characters only) — TODO
Branch `feat/dm-creation-lock`. Owner, 2026-08-06 — *"ideally but not critical"*, and scoped 2026-08-06 to
**cloud characters that are in a campaign**. That scoping is the whole design, not a detail: a DM lock only
exists where there is a DM, a campaign only exists in the cloud, and a cloud character's row is
server-mediated — so this can be **genuinely enforced** rather than merely honoured by the client.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** high — ambiguity medium (the enforcement point is now clear, but the
detach/export edge cases below are genuine judgement calls); damage scale HIGH (it is an RLS/authorization
change on the `characters` table, the app's only real security boundary, and a wrong policy either locks
players out of their own characters or lets them through); damage likelihood medium (the advisor catches
policy shape, nothing catches intent) — worst-of lands at high. **NOT sweep-eligible.**

```text
0. READ FIRST: decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-06-creation-lock-survives-reload.md — its Outstanding section
   is this task. Note its trust-boundary worry is RESOLVED BY THE SCOPING, not by argument: the concern
   was "a player can edit their own local LOG", which does not apply to a character whose authoritative
   copy is a server row the player cannot write freely.
1. THE SERVER IS THE ENFORCEMENT POINT, not the LOG. Per AGENTS.md, RLS is the only real security
   boundary; a client-written flag is decoration. So the rule belongs in sql/rls-policies.sql:
   an UPDATE by the character's OWNER must not be able to clear a DM-applied lock while the row's
   campaign_id is set; the campaign's DM must be able to set and clear it.
2. Decide WHERE the lock lives on the row before writing any policy. Two shapes:
   a) a dedicated column (e.g. characters.dm_locked boolean) - trivially checkable in a policy, and
      independent of the LOG's contents. Preferred: an RLS policy cannot reasonably inspect a JSON LOG.
   b) inside the stats envelope - keeps everything in one place but makes the policy parse JSON to
      enforce it, which is fragile and slow. Expect to reject this; say why in the record.
3. The LOG event is then a MIRROR for display, not the source of truth. The tools still want a
   creationLocked event so pricing behaves (js/engine.js:749), but the engine must stay ignorant of
   auth - it compares values, it does not know who a DM is. Stamp provenance on the event for the UI's
   benefit and say plainly in the record that the event is not what enforces anything.
4. EDGE CASES that need an owner answer, not a guess:
   - a DM-locked character is REMOVED from the campaign (campaign_id cleared). Does the lock survive as
     an ordinary lock, or clear? Both are defensible; pick one and record it.
   - a player EXPORTS a DM-locked character to a file and re-imports it locally. The local copy has no
     server row, so nothing enforces it. Is that acceptable (it is now a different, standalone
     character) or must the export refuse/strip? Note the existing precedent:
     D-GH-2026-07-11-clone-campaign-character-standalone deliberately severs the campaign on clone.
   - a character with no campaign_id can never be DM-locked. Confirm the UI never offers it.
5. DM Console has NO lock UI at all today (grep: creationLocked appears 0 times in tools/DM-Console.html).
   That is the whole player-facing half of this task.
6. Back-compat: no existing character has the column/flag, so default it false and every existing
   character behaves exactly as it does now.
7. After any RLS/migration change, run the Supabase advisor (get_advisors) and skim get_logs BEFORE
   opening the PR - AGENTS.md step 4. This project has been bitten twice by grant/RLS drift.
8. Verification needs a signed-in campaign with a DM and a player account; it cannot be covered by the
   dependency-free gate. Say in the PR exactly what was exercised by hand.
```
**Done when:** a DM can lock a campaign character from DM Console, the owning player cannot clear that
lock through the app or by a direct row update (verified signed-in, both roles), a character with no
campaign cannot be DM-locked, the detach and export answers from step 4 are recorded in a
`D-GH-<date>-dm-creation-lock` record, the Supabase advisor is clean, and engine-parity is unchanged.

## Randomize (and shared links) build in canonical order, not purchase order — TODO
Branch `feat/randomize-emits-in-order`. Successor to the ordering half of `feat/creation-vs-awarded-ap`,
after the interactive and undo/redo paths were fixed (2026-08-06, PR #373 and the addendum in
`decisions/2026/D-GH-2026-08-06-creation-lock-survives-reload.md`).
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity medium (mapping ~30 randomizer mutations to event shapes
is mechanical but each needs the right category and cost, and a wrong one mis-prices a character); damage
scale medium (one tool, revertable, but it rewrites how a whole character is constructed); damage
likelihood low (tool-pricing drives CharGen over CDP and the parity gate covers the engine) — medium.

```text
0. SCOPE — read this before assuming there is more to do than there is. Purchase order is ALREADY correct
   for the paths that matter, verified 2026-08-06:
     - interactive building: emit() appends in click order and does NOT tag noLock, so the creation lock
       lands exactly where cumulative spend crossed the threshold.
     - native save/load: _cgApplyEnvelope reinstates the saved LOG verbatim (D-GH40), so order survives.
     - undo/redo: restoreFrame() now reinstates the frame's LOG verbatim too.
   What is LEFT are the paths where the character arrives whole and no click order ever existed:
     randomize, the shared "#b=" link, and legacy flat-file import.
1. Only RANDOMIZE can be fixed honestly. A shared link and a legacy file carry a flat build with no
   sequence in it - there is nothing to recover, and inventing one would be a lie dressed as data. Decide
   explicitly whether those two keep today's behaviour (whole build creation-priced, lock appended after)
   and SAY SO in the record rather than leaving it implied.
2. randomizeRoll() (~tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html:3407) already HAS a real sequence: it applies ~30
   mutator lambdas in a random order until the budget is spent. That order is as genuine as a generated
   character can have. The work is emitting one event per applied mutator instead of mutating a flat
   build and bursting at the end.
3. The actual cost is the mapping. Each lambda mutates the build directly - x.skills.push(s),
   x.stats[a]+=2, x.traditions.push(...) - and each needs the matching event shape and cost
   ({cat:'skill',payload:{v:s}}, {cat:'abil',payload:{ab:a,to:N}}, ...). Roughly 30 of them. Do not
   guess a category: check each against MUT in js/engine.js.
4. PERFORMANCE - measure before and after. emit() calls _cgRepriceDraft(), which replays the whole log;
   doing that per event across ~50 events is O(n^2). If it is slow, batch the repricing to the end rather
   than abandoning the ordering.
5. Gate it in testing/scripts/tool-pricing-ci.mjs: after a randomize that spends past the threshold, the
   creation lock must sit at the purchase where cumulative spend crossed it, not at the end. Prove the
   assertion fails against the current burst-based implementation before trusting it.
6. Display/state only - no compute() change expected, so do NOT bump DATA.version; confirm rather than
   assume, and keep engine-parity at its current count.
```
**Done when:** a randomized character over the creation threshold has its `creationLocked` event at the
purchase where spend crossed it rather than appended after everything, the shared-link and legacy-import
answers from step 1 are recorded, a gate asserts the randomize case, and engine-parity is unchanged.

## Drawbacks are counted twice — and mislabelled "player AP" — TODO
Branch `fix/drawback-ap-double-count`. `js/engine.js` (`foldBuild`/`compute`), plus the AP display in
Live Sheet and CharGen.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** high — damage scale is high (it changes `compute()` output and needs a
`DATA.version` bump); ambiguity is medium (two coherent models, one is clearly preferable) and damage
likelihood is low (engine-parity fixtures would catch a wrong implementation).

Found 2026-08-07 while checking `Moss Stormspud (COPY)` after the Amble award-event cleanup. With every
`award` event removed his `playerAp` was 4 — purely drawback-derived — which made the divergence visible.

`foldBuild()` sets `b.budget = economy().earned`, and `earned` is awards **plus** `drawbackEarned`.
`compute()` then does `playerAp = b.budget` and `spendable = (ignorePlayerAp ? 0 : playerAp) + dmAp`.
But `total` **already** nets drawbacks (their `cost` is negative). So a drawback both reduces the build
cost *and* raises the ceiling — it is worth double.

Two models are each self-consistent; the engine does half of each:

```text
(a) cost nets the drawback (total 50), budget excludes the refund (37)  -> remaining -13  CORRECT
(b) cost ignores it (total 54), budget gains it (41)                    -> remaining -13  CORRECT
    current: total 50 AND spendable 41                                  -> remaining  -9  WRONG
```

Verified against Moss Stormspud: positive purchases 54, drawback refunds −4, net total 50, DM AP 37.
With `ignore_player_ap` TRUE the engine drops `playerAp`, lands on model (a), and correctly reports
"OVER BUDGET by 13 AP". With it FALSE, `remaining` is −9.

**Scope:** Amble is the only campaign with `ignore_player_ap` on, so it is unaffected. Every character
*not* in such a campaign — including all 8 unbound ones — currently gets double value from drawbacks.

**Also a labelling bug.** `engine.js:476` documents `playerAp = b.budget` as "folded from the
character's own `award` events", which is not what it holds. Under `ignore_player_ap` the UI then says
"4 player AP ignored" — wrong twice: it is not player AP, and it is not being ignored, since it is
already applied as a discount on `total`.

```text
1. Adopt model (a): a drawback affects the COST side only. Stop b.budget/playerAp folding in
   drawbackEarned - playerAp must mean what engine.js:476 already says it means, i.e. award events only.
2. Split the display by which side of the equation each belongs to. Drawback AP is a discount on cost,
   not a pool to spend from: show it on the cost line ("Build cost 50 - 54, less 4 from drawbacks") and
   reserve "Player AP" for actual awards. No new engine export is needed - economy() already returns
   drawbackEarned separately from earned (D-GH41 exposed it for exactly this).
3. Check every consumer of playerAp/b.budget before changing it - Live Sheet, CharGen, DM Console - and
   confirm none of them re-derive the drawback credit themselves, or it will be dropped twice instead.
4. This CHANGES compute() output: update testing/expected/ in the same PR and bump DATA.version. Add a
   fixture with drawbacks and no award events - the case that exposed this - asserting the same
   remaining whether ignorePlayerAp is true or false.
5. Log the model choice as D-GH-<date>-drawback-ap-double-count; a future reader needs to know why the
   cost side won rather than the budget side.
```

**Done when:** a drawback affects the build's cost exactly once; a character with drawbacks and no
awards reports the same `remaining` whether `ignore_player_ap` is on or off; no UI calls
drawback-derived AP "player AP"; `testing/expected/` updated and `DATA.version` bumped in the same PR;
engine-parity **0 failed**.


## Cloud-autosave flush doesn't wait for the freshest edit when a push is already in flight — TODO
Branch fix/autosave-flush-latest-push. `_cgFlushCloudSaveNow()` (`tools/PACT-CharGen-Webtool.html`) and
its Live Sheet twin `_lsFlushCloudSaveNow()` don't actually wait for the freshest pending edit when a
push is already in flight, and neither the flush nor the retry it triggers use `withKeepalive` — so a
deliberate tool-switch navigation (`switchToLiveSheet()`/`switchToCharGen()`) can still outrun the save
it was added to guarantee. Found by `/code-review ultra` on the B3 (universal autosave) branch — a
pre-existing bug in CharGen's already-shipped push-overlap machinery, freshly replicated into Live
Sheet's new B3 autosave scaffolding rather than something either branch introduced from scratch.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity is medium (a clear direction exists — track the
LATEST queued push, not just "a" push — but the exact mechanism has a few reasonable shapes); damage
scale is medium (spans two tools' autosave scaffolding, though fully contained and revertible — no
security/data-model impact, and local autosave never loses the edit, only the cloud copy can lag until
reconnect); damage likelihood is medium (no automated gate exists yet, but the fix's own differential
test would catch a wrong implementation before merge).

1. Reproduce first: a user edits while an earlier debounced push is in flight, then immediately
   switches tools. _cgFlushCloudSaveNow()/_lsFlushCloudSaveNow() call _cgCloudPush()/_lsCloudPush(),
   which (busy branch) just sets *SaveAgain=true and returns the OLD in-flight promise — not one
   representing the newer edit. The Promise.race resolves on that stale push, the switch function
   navigates away, and the retry carrying the actual latest edit fires later from the old push's
   .finally() callback, dispatched WITHOUT keepalive.
2. Fix direction: _cgCloudPush()/_lsCloudPush() need to return a promise that resolves only once the
   LATEST queued push (not just "a" push) has completed, so the flush's Promise.race actually waits on
   the right thing.
3. The retry triggered from .finally() should go through withKeepalive too, since it can fire after the
   page has already started navigating away.
4. Apply the same fix to both CharGen and Live Sheet — they're independent copies of the same pattern,
   not a shared function, so fixing one does not fix the other.
5. Write a differential regression test (testing/scripts/, matching sync-concurrency-ci.mjs's own
   pattern) that reproduces the overlapping-push-then-navigate scenario and fails on the pre-fix code.
```

**Done when:** a differential regression test reproduces the overlapping-push-then-navigate scenario
and confirms the flush waits for the LATEST edit's push (not a stale one), with keepalive applied to
any retry that fires after navigation starts; fix applied to both CharGen and Live Sheet; `testing/
tests/engine-parity.html` still 0 failed.

## Security audit: privilege boundaries + character/AP integrity against a malicious client — TODO
Branch `security/privilege-and-character-integrity`. Owner request, 2026-08-08. Assume the attacker has
the full frontend source, the Supabase URL, the publishable key, complete control of browser JS/
localStorage, and calls Supabase directly — every finding must be verified at the RLS/RPC boundary, not
just in the UI. **Explicitly excludes the invitation system** — `docs/TASK_BOARD_NOW.md`'s
`fix/harden-invitation-system` already owns that surface; do not touch `campaigns.dm_invite_code`,
`campaign_invites`, or `joinAsDm`/invite RPCs from this task.

**Not green-field — audit before assuming a gap exists.** Several of the asks below already have a
documented answer or a partial existing task; confirm the real state (read the actual RLS/RPC, per
AGENTS.md's "verify before writing an absence claim") before treating anything here as a fresh finding:
- `ap` is already documented as server-authoritative, DM-only, never overwritten by a local push
  (`AGENTS.md` File & data map) — audit whether that's actually *enforced* in `sql/rls-policies.sql`/RPCs
  or only true by convention.
- `characters_update`'s RLS already requires `owner_id = auth.uid()` in both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`
  (confirmed via `grep -n "owner_id" sql/rls-policies.sql`, see the `feat/character-ownership-claim-link`
  task below) — so raw ownership reassignment is already blocked; that task is where a *deliberate*
  transfer RPC belongs if one gets built, not this one.
- DM-applied creation-lock enforcement is already scoped as its own task, `feat/dm-creation-lock` (below)
  — its "server is the enforcement point, not the LOG" framing is exactly this task's model; don't
  re-derive the lock design here, cross-check against it instead.
- `feat/ap-model-reconcile` (shipped 2026-08-10, `D-GH-2026-08-10-ap-model-reconcile`) already covers the
  *display* divergence between `compute()` and the frozen ledger; this task covers whether a malicious
  client can *create* that divergence server-side — related, not overlapping. Sequence awareness, not a
  merge.

**1. Role boundaries (Owner / DM / Player) — audit and enforce server-side, don't introduce new roles.**
Do not add finer-grained roles unless the audit finds a concrete vulnerability that requires it. For each
of: DM transferring campaign ownership, DM accessing another campaign, player escalating to DM/Owner,
campaign-membership checks, DM-only operations — confirm the enforcement is a `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC or
RLS policy check, not a UI gate. Do not reduce any *legitimate* DM capability while doing this.

**2. Character/AP integrity — treat all browser state as untrusted.** Confirm server-side (RLS/RPC, not
just `engine.js` — the engine is called client-side and proves nothing about a raw API call):
- AP cannot be set/increased directly by a player write; AP changes require an authorised RPC.
- AP cannot go negative or be set arbitrarily via a crafted request.
- Frozen ledger / LOG history cannot be rewritten or deleted by an UPDATE once persisted.
- Purchase prices in a saved character cannot be client-supplied — pricing must be derivable/verifiable
  from `compute()`, not trusted as sent.
- A locked/finished character cannot be mutated via a direct API call once locked.
- A character cannot move between campaigns except through an authorised path.
- LOG events cannot be replayed/duplicated to double-grant purchases, rewards, or AP.
- Creation-lock rules cannot be bypassed by client-constructed state (cross-check `feat/dm-creation-lock`).
- Species/heritage/2nd-origin pricing cannot be gamed via a hand-crafted LOG.
- A malformed/forged LOG cannot produce a cloud character that persists.
Preserve the invariant **`sum(frozen event costs) == compute().total`** for valid finished characters —
audit whether the server can currently accept a saved character where these disagree, and if so, close
that specific gap (don't build new validation infrastructure beyond what closes the actual gap found).

**3. Campaign-rule integrity.** Audit whether a DM changing campaign rules (starting AP, pricing gates,
species/heritage rules, creation restrictions) can silently reprice or invalidate *existing* characters.
If retroactive application is intentional design, preserve it and say so; if not, confirm existing
character history is immune to a later rule edit.

**4. Cloud/client trust boundary — the general sweep.** For every operation currently protected only by
client-side logic (JS checks, UI hiding) touching AP, LOG/event data, character locking, campaign IDs,
ownership, DM permissions, or character↔campaign relationships: move real enforcement to
PostgreSQL/RLS/RPCs where it's missing. Where enforcement already exists, this step is "confirm it," not
"rebuild it."

**5. Adversarial tests.** Add/extend the automated security suite proving each of: no player privilege
escalation; no cross-campaign read/write; no direct AP manipulation; no forged purchase prices; no event
replay/duplication; frozen ledger immutable; locked characters immutable via API; campaign
reassignment properly authorised; DM cannot transfer ownership (unless a task explicitly adds that
capability); malformed event/state payloads rejected; `compute().total` == frozen-ledger total holds;
existing legitimate Owner/DM/Player workflows still pass. Run the full existing test/security suite
alongside the new tests — a regression here is exactly what this task must not cause.

**Effort:** high · **Risk:** high — ambiguity is high (this is an open-ended audit across RLS, RPCs, and
three tools with several sub-areas that may turn out to already be enforced correctly, so scope only
firms up once findings land); damage scale is high (touches the same core auth/character/campaign schema
and RLS surface as the invitation-system and ownership-transfer tasks); damage likelihood is medium (this
project's RLS/grant drift has bitten it twice before per D-GH15/D-GH12, and the class of bug this task
hunts for — client-trusted state — is exactly what those incidents were) — worst-of lands at high, **never
eligible for `/sweep-code-tasks`**. **Run `/make-code-cold-plan-review` before implementing any fix** this
audit turns up that touches RLS/RPCs/schema — it meets AGENTS.md's own trigger (security-critical,
multi-file, real design trade-offs, and a wrong approach costs more than one cycle to undo). The audit
*itself* (read-only investigation, no schema change) does not need the cold review; a fix does.

```text
1. Inventory every RPC and RLS policy touching characters/campaigns/ap_awards (sql/schema.sql,
   sql/rls-policies.sql, sql/migrations/) and classify each security-sensitive operation as
   "server-enforced" or "client-trusted-only" — this classification IS the audit's deliverable before any
   fix is written.
2. For each "client-trusted-only" finding, confirm it's real by attempting the bypass against a live
   Supabase call shape (not just reading code) — the same standard the invitation-system finding used
   ("verified by reading the actual schema/RLS on preview, not assumed").
3. Cross-check every finding against the three related tasks named above (fix/harden-invitation-system,
   feat/dm-creation-lock, feat/character-ownership-claim-link, feat/ap-model-reconcile) before writing a
   new fix — don't duplicate work already scoped elsewhere on the board.
4. For confirmed gaps, design the smallest RLS/RPC change that closes them — do not introduce new roles,
   new tables, or broader schema changes than the specific gap requires per the Acceptance criterion.
5. Write the adversarial test suite (Section 5) covering every confirmed gap plus the invariants listed
   even where no gap was found, so regressions are caught going forward.
6. After any RLS/RPC/migration change, run the Supabase advisor (`get_advisors`) and skim `get_logs`
   before opening the PR — this project has been bitten twice by grant/RLS drift (D-GH15, D-GH12).
7. Run the full existing test/security suite plus the new adversarial tests; fix regressions before
   declaring done.
8. Document every finding (confirmed gap, closed or deliberately deferred) and every intentional trust
   assumption in DECISIONS.md — including where the audit confirmed something was ALREADY correctly
   enforced, so a future session doesn't re-audit the same ground from scratch.
```

**Done when:** every item in Sections 1–4 has been checked against live RLS/RPC behaviour (not just code
review) and is either confirmed already-enforced or has a merged fix; the adversarial test list in
Section 5 passes; `sum(frozen event costs) == compute().total` holds for every path that can produce a
saved cloud character; the Supabase advisor reports no new findings; `testing/tests/engine-parity.html`
is unaffected (0 failed); all findings and trust assumptions are recorded in `DECISIONS.md`; no
invitation-system file (`campaigns.dm_invite_code`, `campaign_invites`, invite RPCs) was touched by this
task.

## Rate limiting / abuse protection for invite generation and redemption — TODO
Branch `feat/invite-rate-limiting`. Split off from `fix/harden-invitation-system` (TASK_BOARD_NOW.md) per
its cold-review Decision 4 — see `docs/plans/2026-08-08-harden-invitation-system.md`'s "Decisions" section
and its `z-cold-reviews/` files, where all 6 reviewers independently agreed rate limiting shouldn't gate
the core RLS/token fix: once DM invites move to 128-bit tokens, brute-forcing them directly becomes
infeasible, so the remaining value of rate limiting is abuse/DoS protection on invite generation and
redemption RPCs, not closing the core escalation path. No rate-limiting or abuse-tracking mechanism exists
anywhere in this project's schema or policy files today (confirmed by inspection while drafting the
invitation-system plan) — this is new ground, not an extension of an existing pattern.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** medium — ambiguity is medium (whether Supabase's platform-level rate
limiting already covers arbitrary RPC calls, as opposed to auth-specific endpoints, is genuinely
unconfirmed — the answer determines whether this needs new application-level infrastructure at all);
damage scale is low (additive — a new attempt-tracking mechanism, no changes to existing invite/campaign
logic); damage likelihood is low (a rate-limiting gap fails open to "no limit," the pre-existing status
quo, not a new failure mode) — not sweep-eligible given the unresolved platform-verification step, but
low risk once that's answered.

```text
1. FIRST: verify whether Supabase's project-level configuration already throttles arbitrary RPC/PostgREST
   calls (not just auth endpoints like signup/login/OTP) — this determines the rest of the task's scope.
   Check the live project's configuration/advisor output, don't assume from documentation alone.
2. If platform-level throttling is confirmed sufficient for the invite generation/redemption RPCs, this
   task is mostly a verification + documentation task: confirm coverage, record the finding in
   DECISIONS.md, done.
3. If not sufficient, design a minimal attempt-tracking mechanism (e.g. a small table keyed by caller +
   action + time window, checked at the top of the invite-generation and invite-redemption RPCs) —
   race-safe under concurrent requests, matching this codebase's existing atomic-claim discipline
   (UPDATE ... WHERE ... RETURNING) rather than a check-then-act pattern.
4. Cover both directions: generation (a DM spamming invite creation) and redemption (an attacker hammering
   the redemption RPC to brute-force or enumerate tokens) — these may need different thresholds.
5. Add adversarial test coverage: N rapid requests from one caller are throttled after the configured
   threshold; legitimate, well-spaced usage is never blocked.
6. Run the Supabase advisor (`get_advisors`) after any schema/policy change; this project has been bitten
   twice before by grant/RLS drift the advisor catches for free (D-GH15, D-GH12).
7. Record the platform-vs-application-level decision and its reasoning in DECISIONS.md.
```

**Done when:** either platform-level rate limiting is confirmed to cover invite generation/redemption RPCs
(documented, no new code needed), or a new race-safe attempt-tracking mechanism is in place and covered by
adversarial tests proving both that abuse is throttled and legitimate use isn't blocked; the decision is
recorded in `DECISIONS.md`; the Supabase advisor reports no new findings.

## Supabase Edge Function running the real engine.js for AP-budget validation — TODO
Branch `feat/ap-edge-function-validation`. Third of three ideas from the 2026-08-09/10 AP-integrity
external-review batch (`z-cold/` on the `zcold` branch — 7 independent AI reviews synthesized against the
actual code). The other two shipped as one change: `feat/campaign-ap-log-integrity` (a frozen-cost-sum
consistency trigger with a non-regression guard, plus a locked-history append-only protection trigger
scoped to the same boundary Live Sheet's own `undo()` already enforces — the last non-discretionary
`award` event). This is the deferred, lower-priority third leg.

**Why it's lower priority, not higher — confirmed by reading the code, not assumed.** Several of the
external reviews proposed this as the "real"/airtight server-side fix, on the theory that running the
actual `compute()` server-side re-derives correct prices. Checked directly in `js/engine.js`
(`_spendCost()`/`_economyFrom()`, ~lines 617-662): `compute()`/`economy()` only **sum** the frozen `cost`
field already sitting on each LOG event — they never re-derive what a purchase *should* cost from the
action itself. (Only `repriceDraft()` does real re-derivation, and it deliberately no-ops the instant a
log is locked — post-lock prices are supposed to diverge from current rules; that's grandfathering, not a
gap.) So an Edge Function that calls `compute()` server-side gives the exact same guarantee as the SQL
trigger already shipped in `feat/campaign-ap-log-integrity` — both just confirm the client's *declared*
numbers are internally consistent and within server-truth AP, neither proves any individual frozen cost is
*correct*. Its real value is DRY/maintainability (one canonical pricing implementation instead of a second,
hand-written SQL sum that could drift) and broader coverage (could also run `validate()`'s other checks,
not just the budget sum) — not a bigger security boundary than what's already shipped.
**Effort:** medium · **Risk:** low — ambiguity is low (the mechanism — bundle `engine.js` for Deno, call
`compute()`/`validate()` inside a Supabase Edge Function, gate the DB write on the result — is well
understood); damage scale is low (additive: a new Edge Function alongside the existing PostgREST save
path, not a replacement, unless a later decision retires direct client writes); damage likelihood is low
(explicitly deferred — "do only if the SQL-trigger approach proves insufficient in practice," not urgent).

```text
1. Re-confirm the premise before starting: re-check that feat/campaign-ap-log-integrity's two triggers are
   actually proving insufficient in practice (a real bypass observed, not a theoretical one) — this task
   exists to be revisited, not built reflexively once the SQL-trigger PR merges.
2. Bundle js/engine.js for Deno (an ESM re-export wrapper + esbuild bundle, or confirm engine.js is already
   Deno-importable as-is — it's pure JS with no browser globals per the 2026-08-10 review batch, but verify
   directly rather than trusting that claim).
3. New Edge Function (e.g. supabase/functions/validate-save/): fetches authoritative characters.ap and
   campaigns.rules server-side (never trusts client-supplied budget figures), runs the real compute()
   (and optionally validate()) against the client-submitted LOG, rejects the write if over budget or if a
   validate() check fails, otherwise performs the write itself.
4. Client integration: CharGen's and Live Sheet's cloud-save paths call the Edge Function instead of (or
   in addition to, during a transition) a raw PostgREST PATCH on characters.stats.
5. Decide whether to revoke direct client UPDATE on characters.stats once the Edge Function path is proven
   — that's the point where this stops being additive and starts being the primary security boundary.
   Record that decision explicitly; don't let it happen implicitly as a side effect of "the new path works."
6. Run the Supabase advisor (get_advisors) and skim get_logs after deploying the function, per the
   per-change checklist step 4.
```

**Done when:** the premise re-check in step 1 is recorded (with its evidence) before implementation
starts; the Edge Function runs the real, unmodified `engine.js`; a campaign-bound cloud save that would
exceed budget is rejected server-side even when submitted via a raw PATCH bypassing the client UI; the
decision on whether/when to revoke direct client writes is recorded in `DECISIONS.md`; the Supabase
advisor reports no new findings.

# Conventions
- One task per branch/commit; re-open `engine-parity.html` after each.
- Keep `js/engine.js` off-limits unless a task targets it.
- When a task here is done, move it to `CHANGELOG.md` — don't leave DONE items here.
